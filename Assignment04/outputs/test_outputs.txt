You know what I do is write for children, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> it as a farmer, or with clothes, and never nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is generally something that fell somewhere down.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a complicated circle which I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
And I just just just like it to bleed every week in the men's bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by allowing me to go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I did it in secret it.
For three years, for three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a <unk> lover, in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we adults never get to know us.
You could blame Ohio and please bring that man who I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I would like you to get me out please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it one place, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> us from his family, because it was necessary, because it was.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult arrived at <unk> became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany of which I told them was present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was mind.
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to figure out what was in front of me.
I put them up to me around the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was an snow <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or you break the barriers of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hang on to the end, whereas others can't get it more and more <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, by seeing a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, as much as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I'm breathing up its atmosphere <unk>
As a iceberg melts, water releases fresh water that feeds in many forms of life.
And I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it would be the portraits of my ancestry, knowing that in these unique moments there are that way and will not exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice from the <unk> which I photograph I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I would like to show you are from a iceberg I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's a little frequent to really get to witness a <unk> iceberg here.
Here it is.
You can see the left one small boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg of average size.
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so we <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want it to get too much on the details of conception, because if they stop and think about how you think about conception I don't pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and sperm comes together to the X <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joined the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both of them <unk> and it starts life.
We're going to talk about them later.
In my activity I would come two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people started to start the anatomy of anatomy -- so that we have human bodies, and <unk> how they have considered the body body, the idea of <unk> what they think about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of people with <unk> sex with individuals whose physics <unk> it doesn't fit into male and male skills and conventional women.
At the general level, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> lots of forms.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't fall into the common or male forms of male or <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene from the chromosome and tells the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> that are <unk>
And then, in life <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual doesn't have <unk> <unk> the body doesn't react to it.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high levels of testosterone without reaction.
As a result, the body develops following the next female course.
When the baby looks like a little bit of a girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast disease, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
After doing tests they realize that instead of having ovaries and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think that it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women like men, as men, have in the body called <unk> glands in the body.
They're in the back of the body.
The <unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like I -- I -- I consider a <unk> woman, don't know his structure, but I think being a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, somebody like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who have the Yentl syndrome.
So sex is complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in certain ways they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a <unk> <unk> <unk> was born and raised as <unk> I had girlfriend, and sex with her, he had a life like a guy and had just found out he had shiny and womb.
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus -- <unk> glands were so active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, the <unk> were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone in the male component of the male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that in fact, was a woman inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with dramatic chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> that is, they have broken tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason why children with these kinds of bodies -- so they are <unk> twins, or <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> surgery is not to be able to have better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that they <unk> to various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is having a <unk> identity, <unk> being black to say to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you get a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with the <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born as two people inside a body.
The most <unk> case is last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put on web judgment its sex on the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder: "What do you test are going to do to determine whether or <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to reporters that there is no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> we are who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, we have to admit that these categories --  -- we were thinking of these categories of <unk> categories that were <unk> directly with <unk> categories that are much more <unk> than they were <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
In terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology will be.
So as we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we invest in science we go more and more in a uncomfortable zone where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that <unk> are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture today, the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are really <unk> discussions today -- not in the audience, but I know inside the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As much as they put a pen in front of the nose and if it moved on to not <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma of determining someone's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you may think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a <unk> I'm making people with a bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
You know, these categories are much more fragile than we thought to me.
It comes from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so sweeping in what they did, that I find every bit of watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> was for me, the first activists in the anatomy and explain why.
And what they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and he <unk> it with another which was radically and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember what our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the right idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blue.
They were from the idea that it was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the political power from the grandfather to the father and then the son, and so on.
The <unk> were rejected by rejected that idea and replaced it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the field of play and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not differences with them, that was a very radical thing.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And there's very clear, if you look at the story of the <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> power is being passed out of a very vague idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence, they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And it was a consequence of the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they had laid the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think about it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement and saying, "I'm a man."
So again, people of color that are going to be able to focus on the <unk> ratio, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at why, we have to start asking ourselves why we hold certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep a few <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we should respond to anatomy.
I don't want to say that the children of five years were supposed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and that I think we should support it.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in <unk> exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, Mary. were born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, the other thing was born in term: was born March March 1980.
For the only fact that we were born three months before Mary are attribute to all the rights to three months before Henry -- the right to the sex -- sex to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because it was born later.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, actually, by virtue of being considered man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from <unk> compulsory to Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary. For your part, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So there are still <unk> categories that in many ways are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up science but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems like what happens in our culture is a kind of attitude -- "Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people have caught in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a certain point has decided that to marry a man don't have to have a chromosome out, and to get married to a woman have to have the <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't make tests of people <unk>
But this is also very strange because of the story that I told you at the beginning of the Yentl syndrome.
If we looked at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his <unk> "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very <unk>
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this to respect people, because I will admit that I know some of the <unk> <unk> which probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sex relationships than I have to know.
So how do we put the theme of the contents of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured in the future being measured with an instrument, maybe an MRI machine.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live in an example, in a context like Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to the other men is susceptible to being killed, unless they are willing to meet a sex change in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth twins to pick it apart, and so they <unk>
But when the phone asked him the reason for the operation, he asked a very <unk> operation and responded to me that in that other country, these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, he's considered political <unk> rather than the separation <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be in the head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what it would be like to be democracy -- or as it might have been, if we had gotten greater participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different backgrounds, <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about a group.
For years now, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sex difference.
And one of the things that have been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of how we think and operate in the world.
And what we know about studies <unk> is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to worry about those who are embedded in the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I was considered <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has <unk> <unk>
And I thought, "It's the smartest question I have heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking <unk> stereotypes -- so there's nothing <unk>
But the more I thought about the question, the more I think there is something female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the <unk> were very attentive to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that there will be more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the support of <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we put democracy beyond the <unk> to think less about the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> let's think about what we do for others.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth more than their building cost.
So we could easily take it into the world -- maybe hundreds of hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But we just went through the buildings of apartments.
Imagine that half of you who wanted to live in apartment already because of the other half still no longer to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to increase in all the existing buildings.
But you know the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas around them have rules to avoid the insurance and the distractions for construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a totally new place, building an entirely new apartment building, always and when the norms of that place would build the construction instead of putting it up.
And so I proposed that governments were <unk> new enough zones to contain large cities, and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and make those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> happened by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next <unk> elections -- <unk> <unk> formed <unk> with a platform in which promise and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his boss of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a TED talk.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say that you cannot go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
And we spend a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like <unk> norms and usually are the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a Christmas friend sent to <unk> a link to <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a hotel room.
I tried to explain to you this point about valuable things that are much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> which in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was quite an abstract discussion of abstract discussion and at some point, when there was one pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk.
And the talk was describing in very simple terms, that a city under charter <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a charter that <unk> the rules that will spread there and an option for people to choose to go and not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
He asked me to go out and talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value in a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square kilometers.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, we need to start with a site that would be <unk> at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
The whole world is <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> that a new city can provide new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go in that might be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And it also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with the countries that help them to establish and make the rules of <unk> so that everybody could trust that the charter actually was <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This photo is there.
It could quite easily get about a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional disposal that would allow us to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis in Congress in favor of this constitutional <unk> was from <unk> to one.
All the games, all the features in society, <unk>
To <unk> in the Constitution -- you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17, it was passed again to another voting <unk>
Immediately after the voting of 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> of about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center which is being built in Korea is larger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years after it spent four years after it went to the <unk>
The other country in the building of cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this being practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the managers to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the ultimately ultimately for this new <unk> system.
There are urban <unk> and city developers that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing that we know have already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that want to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to move immediately to another place.
There are one million a year from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go back to get work, sometimes they're <unk> mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even there are children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to think about insisting that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> me asked me to say, "Thank you."
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what in the inside, I'm going to make a <unk> public <unk> and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find dress, and more recently, photograph and post on my blog suits and colorful and different for each time.
But I don't buy anything new.
My whole clothing is a second hand of <unk> markets.
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to know people -- usually my money is going to a good <unk> and my mind is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
So what am I going to find today?
It's going to be from my size?
I love color <unk>
It costs less than 20 dollars?
If all of the answers are positive, then I feel like I won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring to someone who has all this <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of inner clothes, and nothing else.
<unk> interior for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that I would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks at TED in inner underwear, --  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, <unk> or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this my brilliant tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can hardly see you phenomenal at less than 50 dollars.
All together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- you don't just love you, you will also love you.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're looking in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember her <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good with something, it's almost secure you are.
And if you think you don't look good with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner outside, there's no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and over again, when people approached me this week, just by what I was using.
Obviously all of this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally emotionally emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another suit, <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little bit of love in my heart and I was after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure <unk> <unk> we could design a plane from our brains.
For example, this would be an entirely logical.
This would be a guy who is totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some of them <unk> for one of these extreme, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not to be mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just like most of the other quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We set out to play with them and then look at them as <unk> and then we develop our intuition to that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you may have developed over the years is that it says that one thing can be only in one place at time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small kid, and he didn't do it very well, it always got off.
But I bet that playing with that bar in the parking bar taught him a precious lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow them to be <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play the car bars, play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of weird things -- like they can go through walls, or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point it was the physics of a few years ago; you needed the quantum mechanics to describe these small particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and perhaps because it doesn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, no one saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logical side.
Because if it's all made of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't be on the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And therefore I would feel so much better if I could prove that a common object is also still the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip here.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to expand a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to small metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of a little bit of metal, with a trampoline way of springboard and that runs into a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip chip and put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> with a swimming range of swimming on the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum <unk> but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up, I stop doing those things, because I don't want to piss you off.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues on <unk> objects are not only people -- it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that happens to their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
And the lights are, then we introduced a <unk> and we pulled out all the air, and then we put it into a temperature of less than one degree above zero percent.
Now, as being just in the <unk> the little metal piece is free to act as you want.
So we measured their movements.
And we discovered that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was <unk> and the way they <unk> it was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when we give it a smooth thrust, we could make it <unk> and not <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing is <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think of atoms.
In one case, all the trillions of atoms that make up that metal piece are still still and at the same time that those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that each atom is in two different places at the same time, which is that the whole metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that little metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why wouldn't you too?
I mean, it's my logical part of speech.
So just imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we get it, and we turned the lights down and look inside the box, and we saw that the metal kept there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator in fact, are actually quantum objects that are just going to fit in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics -- claims everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not quite true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are. And that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art that I was here and I allowed to do it.
It took me 18 months.
Many negotiations and stories, were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story explains simply on this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working at Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So I would better show you the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've conducted from their launch.
So let's say, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery at <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I actually go into one of my favorite ones, the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You're going to move around and get off.
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall,
continue to go forward. <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click out here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured on what we call <unk> technology.
So this image for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixel from it.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You look at things that are happening.
I love this kid, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do it for <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
And I walked in, and I found that the kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit of a little bit, I talked to some people in the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to strike a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even further into depth and you'll see that you really can get into the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move the picture, so you see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best is coming, a second.
So now we're quickly going to jump back at MoMA in New York City.
Here's another one of my favorite, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It increases it and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get into the cracks.
This is the <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it as well before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have any time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that's the same.
You can online and create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just made a <unk> around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and maintain a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my view, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to your art work and it's represented properly online.
And the big question I do today is, you know, you did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a pixel one.
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am from Italian, all the kids in Italy growing up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something really interesting on <unk> races in the last two decades.
It takes some time, if you wanted to win a career of <unk> one, I would take a budget and put it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the career.
So this is what in engineering -- it was <unk> control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the real-time control systems are starting to come into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're turning into the open air.
And as a <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is something big.
As one note aside I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and up to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be something big.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition for <unk> <unk> for the last year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like almost all the existing atoms they were <unk> sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo.
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end of the hammer took the hammer -- and he threw it out of the Moses -- you can actually see a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> <unk> and he said <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and what not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment begins to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a couple of <unk> insisting on the idea of getting the environment and actually <unk> something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of <unk>
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup there.
Maybe some of the remember -- played Italy and France, and at the end of it, gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day by looking at what happens to happen in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
And in the afternoon, the early afternoon are people over here and there doing <unk>
It begins with silence.
<unk> from France <unk> in Italy.
You know, people make a fast call and go in the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First of our first time <unk> ...
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, yeah!
That night they all went back to the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day, they all went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody goes down.
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure your city pulse in a way that we wouldn't have done a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but of things we use and consume it.
Today, we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how it gets <unk>
But we know very little about where things are going.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift, through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one label on the trash and then start <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that we didn't have yet.
They're happening things complicated and there is a lot of dirty transportation.
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> not disappears, which is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we dropped on a day is still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and lots of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at first, which is actually <unk> over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all began with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and southern Europe has a beautiful tradition of the water in public space, in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, join that one?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> which is open and <unk>
It creates a <unk> of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall down the pixels to be written in them, I'll show patterns, images, <unk>
And the curtain is going to open up so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to Mayor <unk>
He liked it very much.
And we had a commission to design the entry to the entry of the <unk>
We call it <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no gates and no windows, but when you come up to it opens up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize your <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, as in this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof goes down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost all the architecture is gone.
This is working.
You look at people who are <unk> by what's going on inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> when the sensors open up the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you leave you -- but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes in the water, and you had to jump to them to jump up to not get wet.
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of the use that people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and each one had a little pixel -- that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which moves with others in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal cell configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, where what changes is the light, not the position of the pixel in it.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears on different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can get anywhere near and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light turns out, you see this -- the same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of the people, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of <unk> today, the star of the New York City and the <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as entry for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left-hand side, you see the <unk> <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go down the way.
And once we have the pixels and play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a potential entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment as an oyster nursery <unk> as a <unk> farm -- but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of them a little bit of a <unk>
And I think what's remarkable that it has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we spent the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Now, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign will tell us, we can move from the digital world of the digital power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but it's covered in the pixel yet.
You can move through the inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, serve to share the major moments of the 2010 Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, as a new <unk>
You can go there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, they could improve it for more accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, to be more strong, have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure from themselves?
How about living with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else do you <unk>
What would you like if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hand.
<unk> probably got to the amount of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you would choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Ah, most of you, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just imagination?
Or perhaps that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference, but I want to give you the look at a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense of <unk> light.
But if you actually embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Is it about the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is of course the one that interests us.
<unk> from a common ancestry with modern chimps about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its vast majority of the basic machinery is roughly the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not as human insulin but it is the same protein, which is <unk> of which it comes out of it.
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the most bacteria that the cells we have on the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> told them about <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, dark -- it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide you all the nutrients that they may want to have no effort to be <unk>
It's really like a fast pathway for the occasional <unk> disruption in the <unk>
But so on, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what do we affect the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something probably better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've been <unk>
When I just went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the <unk> and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms every cell is simply divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two stem cells.
But when the organisms come out, things start to change.
He goes into digital reproduction.
And something very important: with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year he was happening, he had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who are still <unk> in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your hotel <unk>
He opens the door.
In front of him is a magnificent <unk> dancing <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"It's <unk> George, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to be healthy.
I wanted to bring health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and healthier.
Evolution is about moving the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view, you and I are as rockets that are designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us let us fall into the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that he put on, Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to warn you, not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily believe the longevity.
It doesn't necessarily translate the biggest or the stronger or the faster, and even the smarter.
Evolution favors the best creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean, the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish there, fish <unk> into the vacuum, yet they've managed to do that an integrated environment.
So what does this mean -- when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look at the time we look at the <unk> phase, I would argue that there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached some kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we're going to get <unk> and we would be so excited that it's no longer possible to have the necessary isolation for evolution.
A second possibility is that you produce an evolution of the traditional type, which is dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when as a species -- distant planets are going to be isolation and environmental changes that can produce naturally evolution.
But there is a third possibility -- a attractive possibility, intriguing and terrifying one.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in decisions that we have.
Now, how could it happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what they pick up at the individual and family level.
Think about it also that if it could be possible to choose not only sex in your gut, but in their own body, make genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future, that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990 and he sued 13 years.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a close cost to 20,000 and rather than a week.
We don't really have a lot to make the human genome reality, and it will be increasingly more and more to the reach of all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that aren't only going to protect us but will induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course with the vaccine against flu as a vaccine against <unk>
Can you imagine something nice to go out of the <unk>
That's reality today, and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only another two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the egg of newborn <unk> and give her children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes -- to remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same technology is <unk> that same piece of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also allow us to take a better memory also.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could put it with the next generation of the machine machine.
Why not have a <unk> muscle muscle than allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't we live longer?
This is going to be so compelling.
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can give it to 1,000 years and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have before them.
We're going to use these options on a better society, more successful, more successful.
Or, let's pick up selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for anybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do is, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a lot of explosion when you're at 900 feet tall in size.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds frightening.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to <unk>
So we immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot already had a plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
It's usually not <unk>
It takes the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and not <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words <unk> I have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk to the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. It was <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned it all changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to come in, and I didn't, all the fences that I wanted to get in and never <unk>
As I thought that later on, I was a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes, I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gives rise to my ego.
And I am sorry for the time that I <unk> on things that didn't matter to people who do matter.
And I thought about my wife, with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as a <unk> I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to be <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going on <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had a feeling of, <unk> die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell you, I love my life.
And that sadness becomes a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids growing up.
A month later, I was in a acting of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  --  And I scream, <unk> as a small.
And to me, that was all the reason to be in the world.
At that point I understood these two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is being a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And I gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
You guys are flying around today, the challenge that you can imagine is that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and please not be this -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What are they <unk> they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many projects.
But the most great thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
One day he came to her house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has a total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Their work influenced me.
I have a design company, and animation and animation, so that obviously, is a intricate thing we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met his brother and his father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he can communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, not that <unk> seen by Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be important and have a good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Does anybody look at the movie "The <unk> and <unk>
They communicate that way, they're making up with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check, I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I committed to her brother and his father there at the right time, "All right, OK, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk about, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to go back to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside your inner can't <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research <unk> that they have a technology that allows them to project out a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer of that with a laser pointer about that and record negative space.
So they're going around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
First of all, they start with the sex organs, then with bad words, then with the <unk> attacks and in the end, people start making art.
But there was always a cycle of life in <unk>
And so he started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of the organization and a lot of moving things on one side we had a couple of things.
One is, you touch the gates of the insurance companies and we got a machine so that it was <unk> I could read a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get email from him, and you say, "You don't know it. This guy's great!"
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers around the world to get out of all the corners of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we did something completely stupid and that when they were <unk> they would have taken away the walls of the walls and instead it would have <unk>
But for two weeks later, we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a pair of <unk> that we bought in the <unk> walk of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> things and Radio <unk>
We took a camera on the <unk> we put it up on an LED light and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds up, we publish the code <unk> the software goes down in a free.
And we created a device that doesn't have limitation at all.
There's no insurance company saying "No."
There is no hospital that I can say "No."
Any person with paralysis has access to drawing and communicating using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a planning year of planning, two weeks ago, I would have intense intense days of all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and is looking through the support system of your life.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the city parking wall.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lots.
The funny thing was that we had to bust out in the parking lot so we felt like we were <unk> I graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been underwater and someone finally came to me and would pull me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
So that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device, but it's the equivalent of an analog <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to fix it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all sorts of recognition.
We have gained many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up with the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibit called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be at the show which is pretty awesome.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the microphone, the <unk> nothing possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something, and I was amazed with wonderful people in order to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us to do every day when we find something we feel like we have to do. If it's not right now, I am going to be <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last couple years in situations usually very difficult and at the same time such a dangerous time.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk>
Film with difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only -- this is fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been looking at myself in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal to talk about social questions in ways that we are trying to get interesting, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that they get fun and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I was coming here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a couple of weeks away from <unk>
I sent some text messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the name of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it comes to and depending on content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company do it.
But said this, it's a very good chance.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't tell you about certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we tested the marketing world of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've got myself in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing I could do -- nothing could happen to something so difficult or so dangerous to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that trying to do about <unk> <unk> marketing and advertising, and that the whole film is <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call the biggest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The biggest movie ever <unk> is that everything from top to bottom, in beginning end, has a brand, and all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title, <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people went into the film to the film <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's what? It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> I just <unk> it was more <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of brand X in the title, but we're going to make sure that we put all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe that you've <unk>
The most cool car you've driven in "The biggest film that you've ever <unk> the greatest drink that you've got <unk> <unk> of "The biggest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The target goal is the transparency.
You'll see the whole process in this film.
That's the complete idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> But I don't know how <unk> it's going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if it's too <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> No <unk> David <unk> how much money you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult to a meeting with them, but that certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple of big balls.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out of the movie as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers.
MS: But it will be hard for the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: -- it means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to do with.
MK: We have some places where they go. <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies disappeared.
No one wanted to have nothing to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, it was to introduce the product to so much people as possible, to make so much people see him as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media scenario is not the idea to have that new <unk> vehicle that's going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this one.
It actually wasn't such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image represents image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like the way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access to information, especially in practical practices -- being the last bigger problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- the president -- even the <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to making it something changes very suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear that still continues to be.
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and saying that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want them to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to take a story, but we want to make it <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father <unk> me in some lie in some lie -- and there is him looking at me as being used -- saying, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
Is it your story, it's my story, and it's <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take out of the script and go to the businesses I do with all my team.
So what I started to sum up suddenly -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start to talk to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: Now, I have friends who make big, huge gigantic films and others who make small, independent films, like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood Hollywood movies say the reason why their movies are so successful is because of the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The biggest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see you a little nervous.
I want to help you get <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We are going to have so much for man like a solid <unk> to <unk> <unk> whatever.
That's the general view.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen <unk> We're a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are rather a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people of people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
KF: So that's a big question.
Volunteer: matters.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It makes you <unk>
How do we keep them fresh time? With better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of <unk>
I need to talk to the man in the street, people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> One single <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have to be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors, lots of gray colors and things like that.
They usually wear me as <unk> or I like the <unk> or like the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the guy the pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be brand Tom, but I often miss the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they could do it for them, they certainly could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first photo is a familiar photograph.
A: <unk> a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about your sense of being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk> out of that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world in which we are looking around like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come up and start in a place and my case come and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What is the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How do you relate to your thoughts, feelings and your sense of that be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things, I like weird stuff.
A: <unk> of the <unk> for what is the point?
What is the <unk> What about <unk> you find right now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
I think a little bit about that.
<unk> more of you, who are not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
Now you don't have to be scary. What kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: Thank you for your patience, <unk>
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness on all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> on your personality of <unk> it Morgan Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They become very well <unk>
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some companies just put into one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
Many companies tend to -- and it's nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> to prevent fear of fear, those elements -- and you're actually <unk> and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
So what other brands are it?
The first here is the <unk> Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and brands conscious things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to give you your brand, your brand, your brand, what would be?
Are you an arbitrary attribute <unk> You're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather than an optimistic attribute of it.
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be playful as <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> bold or bold like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- magic or mystical as <unk>
Or are you rather than attribute <unk>
You're conscious -- sophisticated as <unk>
You're traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're good -- stable, familiar <unk> safe, sacred <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how you now use MRI resonance to identify the centers of the desire in the brain both for commercial marketing as a movie for film.
We went to San Paulo.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> there's nothing.
And we went to school districts where corporations are getting into the schools with the available schools in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects that I've had the greatest answer or where I've been most successful is those in the ones I've been talking about with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> they took off their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people thinking about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? <unk>
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> Festival -- let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a <unk> period.
That's just in <unk> no press, nor TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this movie has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because most of the agencies that we talk about.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get out to the people of that is pushing into failure.
I think when you train their employees at loss at risk is preparing for their entire company to reward them.
I feel that what has to happen to advance is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities they can afford.
Ultimately, we'll go forward, I think we have to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to go to transparency.
Today, most honesty is ever going to go through a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk, <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED organization of TED, the <unk> Foundation, and I was applied to my assistance for the next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software <unk> are from a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a cash virus on a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
The <unk> entering the gray box, hurts the <unk> and the nuclear nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started investigating about <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that he knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> of <unk> the <unk>
It seemed like to want to do something with these <unk> boxes.
And so that struck us attention, and we started an experiment where we were looking at our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they had very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab in the lab that he didn't like our <unk> <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack?
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box if it finds a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect is actually working on that place:
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> we don't know what is <unk>
Could it be, let's say for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
We'd better take the goal soon.
And so we pulled out the attack, and we found the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs.
We also saw that they were armed with very professionally professionally professionally <unk> by people who obviously had the whole internal information.
They were all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much we <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech and let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very above all we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking at at first was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we tried to fill it with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to the goals of goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> white white and surely located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and plants between our <unk>
I called them and I was asked in an effort to make their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
rotor is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> on an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to data and their structures.
So for example, the number is <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't afford it.
I started looking at scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a waterfall, and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And he got better at it.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that's a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had between hands.
And so that it wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken out after several different weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to begin with.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> just pointed to one and the same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a waterfall, and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicate with six water and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we are very confident that we've determined what is <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry about that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw -- really <unk>
There is the gray box, and the top is the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the input values for example of the sensors for example sensors and the sensors of vibration and provide <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these <unk> data data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the safety camera feeds in video video.
It's really cool.
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act quickly.
So for example, in a power plant, when the large steam turbine is about speed, you have to open vacuum valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this cannot make it a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can pass bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> or the security system <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see specifically, specifically with <unk> <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a power plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this payload with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use the conventional technology of worms to <unk>
<unk> as much as possible.
And if you take that, with what we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All green areas are very large spaces of goals.
We have to face the implications, and better than we're going to start preparing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main thing behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower,
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, again, our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you, <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give you <unk> abilities, or another one that makes up a wheelchair users get up and come back.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that gets in the morning, gives you a big force -- that also increases your speed, and help you, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it to the universe and other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier that, on average, it must take on their back a <unk> load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to carry even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help us handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Universal <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can give you 90 pounds of land for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and execute with great <unk>
So what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then I then raise my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the Twitter users of chairs with the wheels, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in chairs with the wheels, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people, with damage to the spinal column that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair it turns out to be their only choice.
We are also talking about the population of <unk> which is <unk> quickly.
Their only option, many times -- by a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who did 19 years ago -- he had an injury in the <unk> column, and as a result he couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got some sensors.
Not <unk> on crutches to send signals to the computer computer, here on the back.
There are also a few batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move forward with this soft, very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, by a stranger jump in the air, skiing up it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all of it and all of the movement from <unk> down.
Shortly after, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you'll never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole it up to the last grain of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs the bottom of it, climbing rocks and even riding a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future life -- not only for soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of chairs with the wheels, all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival, of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos of the forests of the forests of Congo.
<unk> are, along with the chimps, their relatives living.
That means that we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where the mortal violence hasn't yet looked like yet.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest -- and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary biodiversity of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage scenario that has been extended for decades, and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction would also put in danger of the Bonobo.
<unk> beef and deforestation makes you not fill in a stadium with the bonobos that are left in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the <unk> hidden in the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love playing throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish ties and foster <unk>
With him we learn <unk> and we learn the game rules.
Play increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors.
And when you look at the Bonobos -- Bonobo sees the roots, the same of the laughter, the dance, and the human ritual and a human voice.
Play is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of single, unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I'm not talking about football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what it is doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> it has <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So the sex game is common as much in bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements of the game -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> you can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to come up with this is <unk> a young female who is playing with water with it.
I think that, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner and outside worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, and we interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world increasingly difficult to greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But do it <unk> our way of game?
The game is not <unk>
game is critical.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like the less appropriate for play, you can be the moments in which it is the most <unk>
So fellow primates, we will accept this gift of evolution and <unk> together while we change creativity, the friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I am responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, I was going to fires up as a captain of captain in a fire body, volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteer volunteers get a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a fairly high probability of going.
But still, there was a race to stand against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what was our task.
When I found the <unk> he was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly was going through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing in the rain outside of the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> came first to the captain and he asked him to go back and get him into the dog's dog's dog.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money that, for the rest of his life, he would have to tell the people that I walked into a building in flames to save a living, just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go between the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a couple of shoes."
It was <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the fire department that at that height more or less had finished off the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking about, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden around the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house the treasures for your house where, as I was waiting, his treasure. got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house of house <unk> by the brave demonstrated to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that somebody had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a voluntary fireman witness to the acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have achieved, or they're by making remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you about this: No wait.
Don't wait to earn the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you go now.
We got food in a dining room, <unk> a neighborhood park.
be mentors.
Not every day we are going to have the opportunity to save someone's lives, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So we went to the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the particular block.
The first concrete blocks built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules from a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the largest construction unit used in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> he came up with this.
He called it <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's been estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 million bricks in the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the block, the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic brick world piled on one world where everything was interactive.
Just like the block of concrete, the transistor allows you to create a much bigger circuits and more complex, a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't understand that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they're linked through magnets.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
The brick of it has a colored code.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with one green and very rapidly you can start making older circuits.
A blue blue with one green makes light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
And we got this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a machine machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having that program, connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make <unk> faster or slower <unk> just like this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a <unk>
We want all the interactions in the world to go into <unk> ready to use.
<unk> sounds solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given the kids to the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a light works of night, or why the door of an elevator stays open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, the designers have no expertise in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
So here you can see, with bottles, paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>
Here's an example of a project that you've done, a <unk> barrel of motion.
But hang on, here comes my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of dough that is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, you can download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage the world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company seeks to get involved with the environment focused on the environment.
<unk>
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I've already heard the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we're supposed to do, we asked them to work on government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> <unk>
We had a couple of members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of crossing the Third World We send them into the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
<unk> <unk>
It's a hydrant hydrant in Boston.
So here it appears like I would find a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody else is being trapped by the snow because he knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered in a meter of snow.
How did you get help to ask the help so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment <unk> very much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: the citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did as any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application in which you can take a <unk>
You embrace <unk> when you go back.
In doing so, you put a name, in this case he put it <unk>
If you don't do, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest <unk> applications last year.
But does something that no other technology is <unk>
And it extends viral shape.
A responsible system in the city of <unk> City to see this application realized that I could use it, not for snow, but so that the citizens will make an tsunami.
It's very important to work on these <unk> of tsunami, but people would make the batteries.
That's why it asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just just launch it to make people <unk> to clean up sidewalks when they <unk>
So we now know about nine cities that we use to use it.
And this has spread without <unk> in organic and natural ways.
If you know a little government technology, you know that this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition generally takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that I've done the normal channels that would have taken at least two and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there is a project in the California justice project, which is the time over 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an app that is program in a couple of days, and it spreads into viral form is a kind of shooting warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests to the best ways to work, not as well as private companies as many people think it should be.
Neither as a technological company, but rather as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> it is open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way of the government that has the new <unk> not a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's really good because it turns out that we're very good for action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to engage together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to applications -- every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
Do you feel great frustration in front of it, but they wouldn't be <unk>
And these people know something that we have lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that you get crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because we don't <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The political <unk> the government is.
And because the government ultimately made up of -- you remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way you think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the health care center and information center.
It's the place that serves the calls if you put in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined <unk> at the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, put music well and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a furniture and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
You don't get that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened is this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking to you.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went back to the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physicist.
And it's also a great example of the income of government to collaboration, <unk>
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological technology.
I'm talking about a platform for people to help each other.
So a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connected the two people.
And it might have been connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call control animals, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but they think it's the entrance to the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have a leader <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will recognize our values, our values, and we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is a <unk> superficial layer.
That's why we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> what keeps that being made from that that we funded as something that is going to be operating in our against, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make it <unk>
Because it's where the real job of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
You've got them <unk>
It's a group of <unk> people who have written a very detailed report from 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism activism as well.
And for those of us who have gone ahead with government, is time for us to ask what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really think we get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't preserve government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the governance function so that it can expand to civil society to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act <unk> just to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is in 28 years old, so I <unk> I'm a major generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word <unk> and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everyone will talk.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem doesn't matter to make your voices.
They're using hands.
They bring hands to the work to program applications that make a better job in government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a fire hydrant, taking out of it, pouring a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have <unk> those <unk> and many people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumer -- we're not just consumer consumers that we pay and get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until they don't get <unk>
So I want to ask everybody here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, will be a crowd of voices, or we'll also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulation has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that you say here has impact all over the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic <unk>
And I think we've learned that we have learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you're taught with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learned this in the practice of the law, my work.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough was strong, it was power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia about <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way I saw the world.
She was tough but she was also <unk>
When I was a little bit of a little bit and I looked at her, and she was approaching me and I gave myself a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then get me off.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> I was approached and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him no, I went back to me again, and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that I would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and his attention.
My cousins were running all over the place.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went into the room and there they were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
So he looked at her and smile, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, across the room, went through the room, and he took me out of my hand, and he said, <unk> <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget.
It took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say to you."
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I guess I didn't do it. I said, <unk>
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I have been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I will never forget.
Then he said to me, "I just want you to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to talk to me, is you always want your mother."
I <unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I'll do."
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to talk to me, is that you will always do the right thing, but the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I'll do."
Then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to talk to me is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I'll do."
I grew up in the field, in South Indonesia, I have a brother a year and a sister a year.
When I was 14  15, a day my brother came home with a six <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me and went to the forest.
We just barely arrived at the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's OK. You know, you <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> Today we <unk> and you always do the same thing as we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And I went to the look with the strength of the strength and he said, "Oh, not be you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean by the power that it has identity.
When we created the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they really don't see sense.
We can't get things that don't think we can do.
I think my grandmother would naturally believe that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases with alcohol.
And these were the things that we said, "We should be <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There is 2.3 million today.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my view, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities, poor or black, it's so much <unk> so much despair, by these facts.
One of the three black men in the age of 18 and 30 years is in jail, or in parole.
In urban <unk> around the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in the color are in jail, or in probation.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is much better if you're rich and guilty, than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth does the results of the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not ours.
We're <unk>
I find it interesting.
We're looking at our work with some good developments in our work.
In my state, in Alabama, as in other states, you benefit from rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of male male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it to the next 10 years the loss of loss of rights will be as high as it was before we <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent kids.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where he was sentence to <unk> <unk>
We have in this country prison for children, without any possibility of getting out.
Right now, we are in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row dying.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in some sense, they have told us that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way of how we are in our identity.
There is another form of <unk> it's not about deciding if people deserve to die by crimes -- but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty death is defined by error.
Out of every nine people <unk> has identified one that is innocent who is <unk> and released from the death row.
A rate of error, <unk> an innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
And in aviation you would never be allowed by driving airplanes if every nine that they <unk> you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on history -- I'm talking about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the age that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until World War II.
We don't really know much about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was an alien time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
I was worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you show talks, makes people stop saying that in our history deal with the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of race and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we've historically done.
All the time I would share with each other.
We continuously created tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage them with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome segregation without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany speaking about death <unk>
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's very disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death row in Germany.
It would never be able to be here."
The room fell in silence and a lady said, "There's no way that we have with our story, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, intentional and <unk> we were <unk>
So let's think about this.
How are we <unk> in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We could not be <unk>
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these issues, the positive and wonderful things are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. It makes creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, these realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both of these things.
We've been talking about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never come to TED.
And thinking about them is, in some ways, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
This is how we are. In spite of being so rational to be so <unk>
The innovation, the development is not just of brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that come from the bottom of the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, at injustice.
Now I want to suggest that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we know these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege of being a young lawyer from knowing Rosa <unk>
These women were together simply to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes the <unk> <unk> we're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and do it.
And I said, "Yes, <unk> I do."
And so she would say, "Well what are you going to do when you go.
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Do you know what you're trying to do."
And I started giving myself my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the months of life, without freedom for the kids.
We try to do something about death <unk>
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and when I finished it and said, "You know, <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> <unk> he put his finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very much <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to address those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher than the worst we've ever met.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if somebody is taking something that doesn't belong to you, it's not to be a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who have to be driven by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
So it isn't.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it is very beautiful, very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> we don't have to judge our technology, through our designs, or our rational or rational.
At the end of a society, the character of a society, not the way they treat rich rich, and <unk> but by how they treat poor poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
And sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas are going beyond me in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been convicted of a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison and I see my clients from 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> so they were given as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone in what isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night, I was very late at night -- my God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't are, must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> <unk> a tiny, poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my black milk was 14 to be treated as a privileged man, executive <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there have been some behavioral behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no ethical but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really the <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> it was sent to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to the court for this case, stupid.
I got up to the car and I was truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went out of the car. He walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man -- he was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's <unk> I said yes.
So I approached myself and <unk>
And I get rid of the ear, in the ear, in the time.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That is deeply connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, he went into the <unk>
When he arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> I <unk>
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one I had written those crazy things.
They arrived, the policemen are <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- everybody else, because we talk about races, because we talked about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I got to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look out the window and try to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black, with a face of concern, walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break, a <unk> <unk> showed <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black himself stood up, looked at the <unk> looked at me and he said, <unk> this young audience to tell this young man who keep his view of the target with <unk>
I have come to TED today because I think a lot of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds into court.
That we cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and by dignity.
That our survival is attached to the others.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity should be <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and justice.
And above all of all, those of the people who share this -- I just want to tell you that keep the view of the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> try to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your way of doing something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be an <unk> this spring in which an effort will be made to <unk> the funding that you spend today in punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases are not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes do not get anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funding to get the law to the law, to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, you say it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who think that is this?
<unk> actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes in violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why it emerges this dramatic rise in the population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes. We have three legal causes to bring people out of <unk> <unk> by stealing a bicycle by small crimes against ownership, instead of making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does not do anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- could be the last six days or for the last six years.
The idea is that the media prefer <unk> bad news because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of the day our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain is probably <unk>
And as nothing matters to us to survive, the first stop of all of this data is an old snippet of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning <unk> the danger.
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> of stories, you know, looking at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there's blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news to you about seven days of a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's no surprise that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But it may not be like that.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Maybe the enormous progress conducted in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the extinction species, water scarcity and <unk> has no doubts we have.
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> the problems and the long long we've just done with them.
Let's take it in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average income per capita income is been <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has been reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, the cost of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy went from 25 percent more than 80 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to make more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people living under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, television, cell conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of <unk>
<unk> a lot of this is the technology and, lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we put in technology technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance price for about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- at good and bad time, in war and peace, in recession and <unk>
This is the remote computers that are used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, which my friends from <unk> call infinite computation and networks, robotic printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production, all over the globe, the synthetic biology, and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in "Jeopardy" from Watson, of <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked for the newspapers the best headline I had.
And I loved this one: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the complex of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach them these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, which can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago that would be <unk>
We can now point out a host of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each one of the planet, it's about creating a life of how we can do.
It's about taking that that it's <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum foil.
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of <unk> to Washington is aluminum foil.
You see, even aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like a pure metal side.
It's bound by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
And let's take this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy flow.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk>
It's not about solid and <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electricity cost six cents a time compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have plenty of water.
Let's now talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed to the Voyager spacecraft to Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a famous photo -- how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent per water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent ice is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but also here's one hope.
It's an available technology not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
Is nanotechnology the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen -- this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, he gave me permission to tell me the technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any source source, saltwater, water -- for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that I'll make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which this will be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation by this technology that there is today.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for 2013.
<unk> that warrior, <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that the president Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smart smartphone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
He lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever found.
But the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video video -- images, of books of books and music, diagnostic technology technology, <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe it will get the time to the health care applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to get these technologies into a mobile device that they speak, and because they have <unk> they can be extracted from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the load of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that we don't want to call the food industry and first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the one billion increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of 7 billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, that was connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before <unk> that you add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What about <unk> What wishes we <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy -- and because of using 3D impressions and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion more members of humanity, healthy educated and <unk>
What about voices that we never had before <unk>
What if we give them to <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and be able to act for the first time?
What do we find?
And if you are contributions that we can't <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that small teams guided by his passion with an objective of course, they can do things that were previously able to do things that had only done great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and functionality.
It's something very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with these university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together and started <unk>
And it's shown that today the recognition machine recognition machinery is better <unk> proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power today to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are happening to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you give them three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that you were <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It caught a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is on the Red Red <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets they are still saying they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a pond, in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
It burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 centimeter <unk> the black beard.
And the fish of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had gone down in half.
I went to five centimeters tall.
They would give you a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of fishing fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in the <unk> Europe made a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was to impose to the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad boat, called the <unk> four.
I went out fishing in him, and we did studies in southern China Sea, <unk> and, above all, on the Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny about <unk> remains of coral reef fish.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start commercial fishing
The background is going to be a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk>
I didn't know them, <unk> because they were dead.
He once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they have never yet fish.
But there is no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
<unk> the starting point to start -- on the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have a lot of biodiversity, biodiversity, number of <unk> <unk> the <unk> the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and we extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the succession of changes.
And at the end of the end to keep the <unk>
And that, in large ways, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that no longer are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when societies continue to kill animals without knowing what they've done until some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before it's <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose low animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea of large fish.
They become little frequent because the <unk>
Over time, there are few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do because the evidence presented in a previous way is not in the way that they would expect that to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some hope is that I was a captain such as a captain such as a lot of fish in this area cannot be used, or usually they don't use the scientists of the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
Out of the enormous role that you can fulfill a protected <unk>
Because with the marine protected areas, we actually recreated the past.
It was <unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and is extremely low.
That's for people that you can see a protected marine zone and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase its point.
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think there is the arts and cinema probably can fill in the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the Bay of <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales on the harbor of <unk> 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> I'm going to talk about the story of <unk> why do we engage with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that giving, is to <unk> make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are made viral and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But today, the Web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our world culture.
Anyone can become famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They climb over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, only a little percentage gets viral gets lots and lots of views and wins <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: Open communities of participation and surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
My God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video filmed outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the collections in the spring of last summer.
<unk> didn't say to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a <unk> <unk>
That's what you do if it's called the Mountain Mountain <unk>
I had published a lot of videos from nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet to <unk> the video to <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented with new and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>
John <unk> Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows how often we use.
And just as you were going, <unk> this video seemed to have come from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of Science Science was one of the first people to do a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or an creators of trends embrace a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who are sharing this great intern then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
In the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this communal involvement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an underwater animation with an <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year, they saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there is a <unk> version that has been seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk>
There was <unk>
Someone did an old version of the old one.
And then it made international <unk>
Suddenly a whole community came in, that made this happen to be a silly joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today, not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What about script could have been written that <unk> this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video for minute, just the only thing and unexpected can you get it out of the way that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this big video of a kind that protest <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I wasn't really interested in it.
Casey <unk> I'm <unk> by <unk> by <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevents you properly for <unk>
KA: Thank you to the surprise effect and his humor, Casey <unk> achieved that five million seeing and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth everything new that we do in creative ways.
And all of this leads to a great <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of needing creative communities in participation, the entirely unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media -- a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience which defines the <unk>
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin Justin started on YouTube.
They don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, and it's just the current means of today's media, but we would get the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the single hope of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
And the words, for so much of my friends, I'm now going to do it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died in history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be <unk> but I was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and an marriage marriage and two small girls.
For her, life was destined to be sent to a task -- the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat was slid into the sea <unk> sea ship.
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother had a <unk> with poison.
If we were first -- we would like we would take it out, and I would take it out, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> diving into each <unk> and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came a number of times, but they were fooled by the courage of the men in our boat, or the driver dying and not being able to go for six hours.
But I know the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, he will end the journey was too much to it; and the first apple I tried, given for the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee refugee camp, in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations leading a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a theoretical class suburb whose population is comprised of <unk>
Unlike the <unk> suburbs whose existence <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days twice a turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in I.T. <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, wouldn't mind what was supposed to be, which was generally <unk> was always <unk>
Two security pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there was <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home."
At home.
Something in me are <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were terrified of our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until her nightmares were going to be able to make it out.
She opened a computer shop and then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women came with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> angry and <unk> and <unk> boys trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
and they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student, relentless with what I <unk> of myself.
On the other hand, he was <unk> in <unk> lives <unk> by violence, abuse, of drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them received aid through the years.
And by that job, when I was studying my last year of lawyer -- I was picked up the Australian boy of the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges don't <unk>
So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that I'd never heard of, and in houses whose existence had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters at the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age as she had when she got us into the ship.
And that was not a choice.
<unk> said to me, "Don't be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
And the more I was talking about, the more I was talking about was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were doing -- living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my Ph.D., I realized I couldn't stay in a law race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that is okay to be an unknown stranger, new in the scene -- and not just it's good, but it's something that is going to be grateful, perhaps a gift of the boat.
Because you can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world will be <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that didn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, an optimism <unk> a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
<unk> to a small group of people who said, "You can't <unk> it was a compelling challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of each day, he made a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
<unk> to the night at the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant ones, and we opened us up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and adventure <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
Mother <unk>
17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of his husband, he had a <unk> to <unk> and bringing the cause she itself, and it was much more <unk> he made when I won.
He can't prove it wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room in <unk> when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night, a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have no <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life were <unk> we can now see that the men who would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have been very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I ask myself about the ship.
Who could look like that.
However, I fear the privilege of the easy of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, diving <unk> in each <unk> the <unk> the constant pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantees nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them safe, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here in the fourth or a fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the sky <unk> with the <unk> singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the old <unk> Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and you get into the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I was <unk> the great prince warrior, and I was <unk> I was <unk> a bow and a <unk> to the ground, he could get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was very upset.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to enable magic, I wouldn't kill her.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of life technology was for my most magic.
It became a golden door to a world full of images of pirates and <unk> in my imagination.
I had a sense that mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it from you.
<unk> our inspiration.
That's why I was <unk> I threw this tech world to see how it used to create magic, instead of killing her.
It was <unk> books since 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a <unk> device capable of connecting to the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
Put the text with the picture, animation, animation, and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what is that good for?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is a <unk> I write my name.
And so I get back a character of the book.
In several times, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl gets excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and dragons but the magic of childhood to those ideas that were <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar was always turned off.
So over here, we have to put on the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into what's subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy would come into a <unk>
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a <unk> that I would move into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all of the whole book of fantasy there has always been maps but have static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guides you through the rest of the book.
In certain points of book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people out of India know their counterparts in India know their <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
That's why we're bringing them back into a childhood history.
It is in a story that is trying to do today as the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems for the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> glued to their <unk> they have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can get our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out of the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children don't do it.
So to get this whole guest ritual of childhood we have to go out and see in a chapter, <unk> a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
One boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A child of India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the relative variants of connecting Earth and technology is there many possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have an interaction where you come out with the iPad and the video on and basically augmented reality, you see a group of animated <unk> which come over the interior plants at home.
At a moment the screen is filled with leaves of leaves at a moment.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are connected with technology and magic and technology is coming to each other.
It turns out the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we felt through a simple story.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> University was <unk> in a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that we do, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail to take away from listening.
So this is my Wi-Fi. It's a very simple thing.
It's got a <unk> on and off.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yeah, I have a challenge as you can see.
And I put the challenge to 95 percent <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> it sent my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. And so he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time as you need assistance assistance or some urgency of that way, but look backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I got up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a light.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure now used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week to be available now.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would engage from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their <unk> and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where the patients assume a position, go back to the control and become captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us healthcare because of the challenges we face, as the firing of the costs of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with you with a video video.
We all have checks and shipping in the <unk>
Maybe even we have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the ATMs are <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find strings of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked them, but nobody <unk>
No one knew where to get <unk> saves lives right now.
So what we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public, you see a <unk> please go through <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you sometimes open up in <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to search for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next weeks you use your phone phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to have <unk>
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that we will help us find and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
And I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You might be messaging messaging or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in their place.
Please focus on this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in photography was woken up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
And I mixed with my previous passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very rough road <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want it to look like it was captured in some way as a photograph.
Tell me where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It's more than to do with capture an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem true.
It's the details or the <unk>
We went to light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
So here we have three perfect objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined it somehow can create something that still looks like <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So you get to the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process when I combine the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seems realistic as I think that they don't even forget the things around us in our everyday lives.
But when we combine photographs is very important -- because otherwise something is wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures combined must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are exposed to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to do impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect job.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
So you might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
In personal people, I think it's easier to create a place that we can find out because you don't need to get on danger of ideas that are in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought of this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> part was captured on a pit of stone.
And yes, I even made a red house from the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to achieve a realistic result, I think you need planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here each piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and even a <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details, but the general way.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something weird happens.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light out the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why are we <unk> <unk> <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve in which, let's say, these are the years or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to show you something ridiculous.
It would be something like that.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you take, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb and we would see a straight line.
But if you happen to something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of <unk> transport is as fast as the past of <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go back to that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological growth in economic growth that every few years increases orders of magnitude.
And the question I want to pose is -- to look at these <unk> curves that we see not still forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
I would give one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all it can happen.
I'm optimistic, and I think maybe something like this.
So, now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is: What is that new way to adopt the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we are embedded in it.
I remember a kid in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's all that we see.
In other words, the future has <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
And we can feel it. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years, because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how that transition that we <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technologies.
Because I think the only way to understand is taking distance and looking at things over the long term.
The scale of the time I would like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back about two and a half billion years when the Earth was a large sterile rock with many chemicals that were <unk> around it.
If we look at the way that chemicals organized us we give you an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, it had floating some <unk> of oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those drops of oil was a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring out materials from the outside and so the drops grew up growing up.
And they began to divide.
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms, those <unk> of oil.
But those blobs were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time you were <unk> it will be <unk> a <unk> distribution of the chemicals that we have.
So each <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow becomes better at the time of incorporate chemical <unk> more <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
They usually live longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, life, very simple, but things became interesting when these drops learned the trick of the <unk>
Somehow, we don't really understand these <unk> they learned how to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution with no sense, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were so <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white powder that I try to hide from the security of the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA, and it would take it 10 to the 22 times.
So if somebody wants to have 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every single person in the world and is here.
If I was a <unk> I would have put it on a virus and it would have spread through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy.
But then it occurred another big step in which things were <unk> very different and that was that these cells started exchanging and communicating information in the cell communities that are cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So, for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin, and they are <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there are a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to communities that, in a way, they were put together in a way, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community were <unk> and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came to so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the entire recipe for the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities that are communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't use without the heart cell or the muscles.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels that cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that were not making more than processing information in community.
It's the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process that information that those microbial communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures to understand and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So a organism could, for example, learn how to eat some fruit because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures that has greatly accelerated information the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to be able to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here sitting here emitting some <unk> and, hopefully, by building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that keeps some analogy with my own.
But we take something very complicated to make it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to do abstractions.
Now we go through periods of similar periods of organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The <unk> computer tape <unk> the <unk> and so that's the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen at <unk>
You already saw the evolutionary evolutionary <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And we've now accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you, took a billion years each.
The next couple of the nervous system and the brain, it took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> and so forth, took less than a million years.
And so forth, like the electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster you do.
And I think that's what we observe on this curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I get my life to design computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without any possible scientific advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that it would be impossible for me to be able to <unk> in a <unk>
I don't know that it makes every transistor in that whole machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine that does something that you didn't do before, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, <unk> <unk> you can run a hundred million <unk> <unk>
You could run these sequences at random, run all of those programs, and take those more than we would be able to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are more close to different <unk>
Of course, they're unlikely to have random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
And we would take those and <unk> to the rest.
And now I think that they better ordered the numbers.
And let's go back to a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that we have children, which are <unk> <unk> and that children will make the properties of both programs.
So we get a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat <unk>
Tell me again.
We would have a few mutations in.
And it tries to come back and try another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complex cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are absolutely perfect.
In fact, it's much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at these programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried <unk> to see how they work.
They are dark programs.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
Once I was in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, don't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make processes of different design.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
But we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use these programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they are <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all of these technologies <unk>
Are we <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let myself give myself some of my false <unk> on that.
Before I treat my talk, we talk some baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end of the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of getting <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you have heard of it.
It's called the average <unk>
And we're talking about 300, a <unk> that we can read 300.
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game without being <unk> and that whatever I try to throw it to the first base, it didn't get time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three of 10.
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 on the Big <unk>
Well, actually, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that of 10 <unk> hit me.
<unk> like Britain's legendary Williams, the last player in the League of <unk> League of <unk> in a regular season in a regular season.
Now I want this to my world of medicine where I feel much more <unk> or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and it's <unk> a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place away and a dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family physician would bring it to a cardiologist whose record <unk> is 200 <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting remarkably much better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But would you ask them.
What do you believe that you should be the average of a heart surgeon, or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is <unk> the world, and I include myself with the mandate of being perfect.
We never, ever made a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student, <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> studied until a blood test.
Maybe which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nurses residence in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and muscle labor, the fork in every artery that comes out of the <unk> and diagnostic diagnosis -- frequent <unk>
And even I knew the differential diagnosis of how to classify <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was going very well; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you were to <unk> everything, then I would know everything -- or as possible as possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident on a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady into the emergency service where I worked.
I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when I was able to stand up to a cardiologist I was going to attend that patient to go to the patient.
And reporting to the chief of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, what was struck by heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops going to work and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to lungs, these are <unk> and so there's a difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I was <unk>
I gave it <unk> and medication to alleviate pressure on his heart.
I gave it <unk> water pills so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of seven.
I didn't get up the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, it would have been able to give birth information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident as a constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of assuming that I could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it to her house, I didn't take any attention to a voice in my inner and say, <unk> it's not a good idea.
In fact, I was so confident that until I asked the nurse I was taking care of Mrs. <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said with total <unk> "Yes, I think being right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
And so he signed the <unk> and the ambulance together with the ambulance took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in your stomach.
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I would go back to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was in order to go home. And at that moment I did something that I didn't do normally, actually.
I went through the emergency service service home.
And there another nurse, not that I was taking care of Mrs. <unk> before, but another one, he said to me about three words, those three words that most of the emergency emergency doctors would come from.
Other specialists fear the fear too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients that we see.
So the three words are <unk>
Do you remember the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "You know, she <unk> with the same <unk>
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
In an hour of having come to his house, after I was given the high of it, he suffered a <unk> and his family called the <unk> the ambulance brought the emergency room with a 50 blood pressure of <unk> which means a severe shock to it.
I was just breathing and he was blue.
<unk> staff <unk> all its resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and expected to all hope that it was <unk>
And in the age of two or three days it was clear that we never <unk>
He had an infected brain damage.
The family got gathered together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And at ninth day, they let them go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
So the weeks I've been asked to do with it, and I experienced for the first time <unk> shame that there is in our medical culture and sat at me alone with a healthy shame because you can't relate to your colleagues.
You make peace and never more made that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> embarrassment that I talk about is what makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that feel.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I <unk> things and made sure that I didn't tell me.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did I send her home?
And my worst <unk> Why did I make a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little at a little bit of that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on one day, he opened the sky and finally came out the sun and asked me if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me that if you were to <unk> the efforts to be perfect to make more errors, I would have to cease those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it turned back again.
Two years later, I was in an emergency department in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into her throat, was a bit <unk>
He sent him penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door kept pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my women's shift, my boss asked to speak with me <unk> in his office.
And he gave the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well he came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially mortal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not because of the throat, but the top, and it can cause the close of those tracks.
And fortunately, she didn't die.
They were <unk> antibiotics for <unk> and recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, and I went back to work, until happened again and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were killed by 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought he had a <unk> calculation of it.
I had an X-ray X-ray -- but it turned out to be normal -- a colleague that I was checking out the patient -- some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner.
The other patient was with lots of diarrhea.
I read a liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
And I looked at it and the certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, I called a surgeon.
Both were operated on and recovered well.
But every single case was <unk> me <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most significant ones have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't tell you and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how I can share this with my <unk>
How do you show them that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the errors of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- believe I would have difficulty looking at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The overwhelming denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that don't.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you go away from medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will get safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of about diffusion and journalism and medical journalism -- I've done a personal medical management study and political mistakes.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes happen every single day, where one in every 10 drugs are born in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right in a system where <unk> infections are increasingly and more, and <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 25,000 <unk> by political <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute set up 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we don't care about.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in his chest, and it comes with <unk> eyes and <unk> and all of a sudden, my story is <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't <unk> their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we remove all the professional professionals -- well, I'm not going to get anybody.
And with regard to that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, artistic art, it's a habit to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery, <unk> This is my worst <unk> blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
And their students were <unk> <unk> down the head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And he starts with a doctor every time.
Now, the <unk> <unk> is human, you know human beings, they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but he tries to try to learn from what happened to teach others.
It would take their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
We would make people's mistakes in other people not intended for <unk> but in a loving way, and support for everyone to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes back in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel so much but I get effort to learn something that can transmit others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me close with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average number of choices that says to pick up an average American, it's about 70 to day.
Not a lot ago in a research followed for a week to a group of business presidents
The researchers recorded all the different tasks by <unk> by these executives and the time that they were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or over time.
Now think about your elections.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do we <unk> the way that manages those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choose to be able to pick up the overhead.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I do a question, like I'm blind, you raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, are ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this big supermarket <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were about 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and some of the 25 water <unk> and this was when we were drinking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but at one occasion, I asked myself, why don't I never buy nothing?
This is the shelf from the oil <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked her, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists who came out every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to make a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
pathway.
They had <unk> different classes.
He took a post to <unk> just at the shop.
We put out of six <unk> or 24 flavors -- different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop trying to test it.
More people stopped when there was a <unk> that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were most likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
What stopped when there was 24, only three percent got to buy <unk>
In the ones that stood up when there was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people have six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably miss -- it's probably not good to keep the <unk> but it turns out the problem of the algorithm of choices is affecting us in good decisions.
We decided to not decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, savings savings now.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we were looking at decisions about savings for retirement of a million Americans, among about a million American plans to this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funding agency available in savings plans for retirement savings plans to save people to save for the future.
And we found that I really had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans from two to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger it was the number of funding -- there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they want.
And the plans that offered about 60 <unk> the rate of participation went to the 50th 1960s.
It turns out even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for the ones that decided to participate, the older it was the number of choices, more people would be allowed to avoid the actions or hedge funds.
As much as we had more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial financial account.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have to focus on to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we have seen three negative negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely one is that we make the decision that <unk> even when this is against their self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance, and in health.
They are more likely to pick up less <unk> even even though it gets better.
The main reason is that we're going to be able to look at that massive array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to be able to fill it up and pick out of that stunning <unk>
Today I want to propose to four simple techniques that we've collected in one way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But what we're seeing is actually what we're seeing is that if you decide to cut, get rid of odd choices -- there will be an increase in sales -- costs, the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Prime Golden corporation eliminated the products for <unk> cats that fewer <unk> increased the <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and lower costs.
It is known as today, on average, offered 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store there is about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce, on it.
In the world of financial savings, I think that one of the best examples that have come out of how we manage the choices is that David <unk> of David <unk> the Harvard <unk>
All the employees at Harvard are <unk> automatically at a fund of life for life.
Who you really want to choose, you give them 20 <unk> not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
These are all <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are between those choices.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking about <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience a vacation with every paid road to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you for a few seconds to get it, and then I want you to give you a round of applause. If you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk>
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew that there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really had to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first <unk> that in the second one, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the <unk> problem of choices, which is <unk>
And so people understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete ways.
Why is people spending 15 percent more on average when you use debit cards or credit card than when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it look real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And in that meeting that <unk> exactly as <unk> we did a little <unk>
And what we added was that we added to the staff that would think about the positive things that they would spend in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a rise in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their delivery accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a hallway that we did in a <unk>
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> along the corridor of <unk> the magazine show can hold it from <unk> different types of <unk>
But, you know?
Because the classification tells me how to <unk>
These are two pieces of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> you give a <unk>
<unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> you give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This rating scheme is completely useless.
The categories must indicate something that they <unk> not when we were <unk>
It often looks like this problem with those huge <unk>
Are you supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than we think, if you just get it a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's make a good decision to make a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows me to completely <unk>
You have to take a thousand decisions to put your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box box is about four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order when the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from many options, 56 colors at a few days, four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few options, four <unk> to 56 colors, lots of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How do you have.
If you add a <unk> button in each decision, this indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones who come from many choices to day -- the default button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to a lot, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order when the information comes in.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although we pick the box of changes to do nothing about the preferences of interior decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more engaged in the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we can manage more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've been presented to you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their issues, or for the people who will work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful about <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices better to do the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in the East Germany, <unk> if you had a computer machine to write to the government.
You had to record a piece of text from example written with the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of the <unk>
If they found a writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint into the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much that we have to do, the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer and it prints a page, that page will end up having a few yellow print on every page that makes it from one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to do a lot of <unk>
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the world's biggest causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world we can put together attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> city in Ukraine.
<unk> phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, huge amounts of it.
There are really lots of <unk> online cases, <unk> that we would raise money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys make their fortunes online but they do it by illegal media using banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought a computer computer.
The U.S. secret service two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> don't know their <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us is a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going on wrong with worse.
In the future, most crimes <unk> online.
The second group of <unk> on importance today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate them to motivate them laughter.
And groups as Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who made it to protest and the last group are the National The governments that we make.
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an instruction authority from the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
It will break the break last fall because of a <unk>
We put the safety of the site and <unk> a <unk>
Last week I asked the Dutch government meeting, I asked one of the leaders if he asked one of the leaders if you were to <unk> the death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how do people die from an attack of these?
<unk> is an inorganic authority.
<unk>
So what do you do?
Well, you need a website -- you need a website <unk> services like <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we have an active foreign authority authority.
And that was going to be used by <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters in the Egyptian secret officer in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based on Germany who had sold the Egyptian government to intercept the big scale of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 18,000 euros to the Dutch government.
The company <unk> is right here.
So the Western governments give us tools for governments to allow them to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, only a couple of weeks ago was found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If one is suspicious of a criminal case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's more there.
They <unk> connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and listen to online discussions -- to get our data.
When we think closely about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why is it <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
So if we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right right that we spend today, to be forever.
Are you going to fit in any future government, in a administration that we could have in 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south of the National Park.
This is the cows of my father, in the background, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi doesn't have fences in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, they follow them, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one that they killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only bull we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and that's why we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
People were dying of our community and livestock -- and they are also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few of the National Park.
A child in my community, six to nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought lions fear them.
But I realized that really not <unk> because I even helped the lions see the pen <unk>
Don't get me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
It was trying to trick the lions so that they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very smart --  they came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they went back and said, "It's not always here. It's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, male lions didn't come back.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that to turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp from a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> electricity to the little <unk> box. I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> makes the lights down.
As you can see, the <unk> get out there, because that's where the lions.
And this is how you see the lions when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> to lions so that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the homes in the neighborhood had heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights up.
I said yes.
<unk> you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've invested in seven houses in my community, and they are serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now by Kenya, to frightening to other predators as <unk> <unk> and it's also using it to suffer from farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International International and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise money and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community, and we set up lights in the houses that don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a child in the meadows of the savanna <unk> my father's cows and I used to see airplanes to be able to be inside of one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in an airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to be an engineer from aviation and pilot when he <unk>
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saved to cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with male lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't think of what's exciting to you to hear a story like yours.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on the electrical <unk>
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a fence about it.
<unk> I know you've already invented fences and <unk> but I want to make my own.
CA: So I did it once, right now, right now, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I got a couple because I got a <unk>  CA: On the <unk> Richard <unk> are something big.
We're going to be <unk> every step I have my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a kid, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would move all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea -- Japan are the enemies.
Though I would sometimes ask myself about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until it all changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public audience.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I've never spent hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we do this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in two past two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're prepared to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At the short time, when I was walking across the train, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A <unk> woman was dead dead on the street holding a child lying in his arms looking at her face of her mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about treating them and their families.
It's a huge famine famine in North Korea in the middle of the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during famine and only few men survived fish, insects and <unk>
They also made more and more prevalent the energy cuts all around me was completely dark at night except by sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite photograph of North Korea in the night compared to the other neighbors.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, he saw bodies floating in the river, sometimes.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just difficult -- but also dangerous, because North refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became a reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> me in the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> he said to another, "This was a false <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum <unk>
But many people can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although there were had been eventually released after a hard international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they are <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all their world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to be a risk going to South Korea again.
And I started new life again.
<unk> South Korea was a much greater challenge than I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I also understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was not a country that I could call my <unk>
Although I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the income exam to college.
Just when I was beginning to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities -- some money I sent to my family, and as punishment -- my family was going to be moved to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to run away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the road to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and <unk> to the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost got a few times.
Once, our bus was arrested and <unk> by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the identification of all of us and started asking questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border border in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated by crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was liberated in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital capital.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the <unk>
I was going and came out of the <unk> office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But he didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man wondering, "What's the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind asking questions.
With my poor English and a dictionary I explained to him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM -- and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and put them in prison.
I was <unk> with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The unknown unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the people who are <unk> when I was more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of international community are really the rays of hope that the people <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea.
But getting their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or none of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice of English language practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us are still in contact with relatives in the world, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity for international support.
I'm sure you'll see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> fast-food <unk>
So the city planners got together and they thought, we're going to change the name of Southern Center so that it represents something else, so they changed to South Los Angeles as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South <unk>  <unk> <unk> fast, <unk> <unk>
Just like <unk> million of other Americans, I live in a desert of food, Los Angeles Center, home of food to take and eat in the car.
What's curious about it is that food places to keep killing more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles South <unk>
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I think that it will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if they didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see chairs <unk> and sold as a car <unk>
I look at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, was plant a forest of food in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters by <unk>
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what come to me, because it's my responsibility and I've got to <unk>
That's how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put us together and we started planting our forest of food, trees -- you know, the nine vegetables <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of paid group of <unk> and the <unk> of the gardeners of all of the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city went on top of me, and <unk> gave me a <unk> saying that I had to take my garden, <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on.
A court order to plant food on a piece of land that nobody <unk>  So I was like, "Okay, let's do it."
Because this time was not going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a request in <unk> with 900 <unk> were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It's got <unk> kilometers of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's space enough to plant <unk> million <unk>
Why on Earth do they not like this?
It's a plant that's a <unk>
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivates your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up there. <unk> my children there.
I was afraid to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for others, and I'm going to show you my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Like an artist <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, as a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do, if you let be your canvas.
You just can't imagine what's a sunflower and how it affects the people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became an education tool of a transformation tool.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You can see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most respected act and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and his daughter, was like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garden, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who was so close to me with starvation, and this just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't believe that people are going to steal your <unk>
And what I say, "Oh my God, I'm not afraid you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to be <unk> but in turn, I want you to take your <unk>
And there was another occasion when I put a garden in a shelter in a refuge for <unk> at the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared her stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant with her mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, so it was just just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, and they work and <unk> all of the volunteer plan.
If the kids are growing up, the kids will eat <unk>
If none of this will eat tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and the body, they eat blind to what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they're caught. I see these color guys that are on this path designed for them that don't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys that we can train from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole set of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take the container and turn them into healthy.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about it for free, because it's not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is putting people out of work to get the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening the farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That the <unk> take their <unk> OK?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I don't call if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>
It's made out of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water at asphalt that we can have.
And especially if you're <unk> on your bike and these cars, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material.
The solution for that is to make <unk> roads.
The asphalt -- <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can move through it, so that all the rain water will flow up the sides and have a road that is easy to drive, and it will have a road that is easy to drive, and it will be <unk>
Noise also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise away, so it's a very quiet path.
It also has a <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that it can be <unk>
So what is <unk> Watch that on this road the surface rocks <unk>
First of all, then several more and more and more, and so on, and so on, and so on, and you know, I won't do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create holes with that.
Oh. Okay.
<unk> of course, that you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how the damage comes out in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> of light to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and separated from <unk>
So if you're driving around the road, you will get the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool from that to clean up, and we can cut the wool out of steel on very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we are asphalt with little pieces of <unk> of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you can use it for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, you particularly steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is they heat steel and melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones will move back to the surface.
I was using an oven <unk> because I can't bring the great machine to come up here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the exhibition, which I'm now going to take to see what happened.
This is the show that it comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to make a test lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the <unk> and then, of course, this road road several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took lots of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We made aging data, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say we've done a material using optical fibers bringing together these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, you can even make a lot of money out of the surface.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how the repairability is.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember imagining myself a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC in his little red radius.
He had a great smile on her face who was unusual at the time, because the news generally <unk> it.
"The Taliban was <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school school school, he said.
I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban was lifted up from Afghanistan and made illegal than girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to get my older sister to my older sister who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we were two possible <unk>
Every day, we were able to take a different route so that no one could suspect where they were going.
We had to hide the books on market bags for us to look like they were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our <unk> the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every once in a while, the school was suddenly suddenly a week, because the Taliban would take it.
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters was <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my mother, out to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my educated mother became teacher.
This is her.
It lasted two years ago, just to convert our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to receive education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate their children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember that there were times when I was very frustrated with our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter of mine, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can let them leave your house during a war.
But there is one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you still want to do it.
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age women have more than high school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from his home to educate her daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He didn't just get away from my college degree, but I was also the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it out of the streets in Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I sleep in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families that, like the mine, <unk> for them, even though it and even in front of an immediate opposition in it.
As a <unk> It's not its true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When I got to your house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> a voice that if I kept sending her daughter to school, they would go back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but I don't hurt the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most people who are <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they often are the first compelling <unk> in the future of your daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school to be told, remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
And I think that these changes wouldn't last a lot, after the retirement of the U.S. troops.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, I see them, I see a future <unk> and a durable change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> I was <unk>
Like me, they dream for me.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk>
But you never get a revolutionary <unk> <unk>
They have spent nearly two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the <unk> of massive <unk> both of the revolution called <unk>
One forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the regime of <unk>
And he <unk> it was a big revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were in the <unk> Institute, each of the regime, carrying freedom, dignity and social justice.
They have shown a <unk> the <unk> the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> the East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a few losses of about 50 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have dear, along with many other women, rebuild civil society, <unk> a direct transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> about 300 to <unk>
After a period of 33 years from exile, I went to Libya and with one single enthusiasm I began to organize workshops about development development and skills of leadership.
With an amazing group of women, we founded the Women's <unk> <unk> by the <unk> a movement of women, <unk> leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the women's autonomy of the woman and for our right to participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> of domination and <unk> policies and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in 52 years.
Yet a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and revolution like everything -- were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on it.
Another day, we woke up with the news of the American officers of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and the Human rights violations.
Our society, made up of a <unk> mentality -- more and away from the ideals of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> the <unk> and the vengeance became the icon of the revolution.
I'm not here today, at all of us to deal with our history of success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
I'm right here today to confess that we, as nation, we choose wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices didn't brought the peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and candidates. brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by the selfish policies of domination, and they're going through both men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and creating consensus more than the election needed the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the political representation of the feminine <unk> more than I need to need the representation and we used to do it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech that not only <unk> but also putting the <unk> instead of <unk> collaboration instead of the competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that an Afghan Libya, by the war, desperately desperately with the end of peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between the female perspectives and the male amongst them.
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known as all the traditions of the traditions -- has the same root in Arabic, that the word <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> which spans the entire humanity that men and women, from which all the tribes and all the towns have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus is completely covering the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion all <unk>
This is how you say, "My <unk> Does all the things."
So he says, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
And that all of them were <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a compelling question that has a equally <unk> response.
This is the <unk> secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the fact that everybody is going to be <unk> Why is it left?
Why would someone stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. He had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor of <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> <unk> and I had a very big secret there.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, which I was creating my soul <unk> <unk> my head with a <unk> loaded with <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved more than anybody in this world, he put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical one of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent the bulk of my career working for <unk> companies <unk> among them -- Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Washington <unk>
I've been married about 20 years married with my second husband and we have three kids.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all races, every day, every income and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> or said otherwise, in families -- the last place that we would want to or expect to find <unk> which is why, domestic <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who would sit down with a man that he did, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women of 16 and 24 years old are three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I was also a typical victim, because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and rainy night night night.
I was sitting next to my hand in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had had just <unk> from a university of <unk> <unk> and I worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most about that first encounter was it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a boy in the field.
I had some big <unk> like apples and a <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things he made <unk> from the beginning, was creating the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it mainly at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started to go out and loved everything from me, which I was list, I had gone to Harvard, that I would put a passion to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like nobody had ever done it.
And it was why the arts at that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leave my dreams, but I thought I'd do sacrifices for your spouse, so I <unk> left my work and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling in a <unk> <unk> who was entering a head in a head and financial trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that place where they were supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another shot on the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that she lived on a little bit.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns actually were a message to me, and even though I had never lifted me my hand, my life was already at danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack took five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's suit and married him.
Despite what happened, I was sure we were living happily forever, because I loved her, and he also wanted a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was simply a lot of sense to me because of the wedding and the fact that I form a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I would never make any harm.
I spent two times more on our moon.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> me, and he gave me so strong in the head that I was <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back our moon of honey and turned through the traffic and threw up a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> went to <unk> one or twice for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or harassment at some time in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control suggests that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
So back to my question: Why would I tell my question.
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man and was the only person in the world who could help rise to their <unk>
The other question that everybody is doing is: Why don't you just don't know.
Why didn't I <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people ask people, because we give us the victims, we know something that you normally do, it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is kill her.
More than 70 percent of violence in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has finally put to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> no longer has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent harassment, even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, <unk> from financial resources and manipulation of the family court system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who went to their mother.
And yet we still are wondering why it's simply not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> up up to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it would be allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody, the police of my neighbors and my friends and my friends and all of my family friends and so I'm here today because all of you helped me help me.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims like headlines -- <unk> women -- <unk> <unk>
The question, "Why is it <unk>
And for some people is a way to say, "The fault is <unk> as if the <unk> victims were deliberately signing up <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them, and that <unk> their lives of joyful lives and happily like <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I was <unk> with a cute and cute man and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to come back to have never more, ever is a loaded gun to my head in someone who says I will.
Right now, as you are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what silly <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people that are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting their daughter, her sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy, particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> abuse is only silent.
They have the power of ending domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
We need the victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They would get the <unk> to the light talking about it with their children, their coworkers and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as amazing people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
It will take the signs of violence in order to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims safe safely.
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis of safe and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am model.
To be <unk> for 10 years now.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dress in this room like this.  Luckily, I brought her clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of fortune <unk> I think.
If some of the women will be <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to get them up, but figure it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. They're very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to pass this sweater through the head, because it's when you're going to laugh me, so you don't do anything as I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I'd never had a boyfriend in real life.
And the photographer was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer told me the back of the back and that <unk> the kid.
Of course, except for surgery or an artificial tan as the one I made two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our respect, which, even though superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I am a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you have to be model?
I always say, "A <unk> discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason that I made myself model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as and youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also teamed up with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known to harness to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of fashion that <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> to know both of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York City told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, only <unk> is to say, less than four percent, were not white to say, less than four percent, weren't white people.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be model when you grow up.
And my first answer is, I don't know, I didn't take care of that.
But then what I would really tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon, and ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first first.
If after this spectacular list, still <unk> No, no, no, <unk> I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of <unk> <unk> or <unk> executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of us want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work that you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've taken your studies, and you have a shock and a few jobs on your backs, no matter what you <unk> is, if you want to be the president of the United States, but your actions will be able to be president of the United States, but you have a copy of your inner clothing for 10 years, people would look at you weird.
The next question that people are always doing is if all of the photos will be <unk>
And yes, virtually you can get all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have a <unk>
I know we're going into a personal field, but I was a little girl.
So I looked up next to my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
So here I am with my football team and in Science magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not myself in those photos.
They are <unk> of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do me is: Do things for free?
I have too much as a two-inch heel. I have never use, except the last couple before, but the privilege I get is the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> got a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent for being able to continue <unk>
<unk> of these privileges <unk> I don't think of what I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for them no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, of teenagers who were <unk> and <unk> 86 percent black were black and Latino and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black people in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's how many times I was <unk> and <unk>
So when I research this talk, I learned that 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure comes up by 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give you an answer that maybe you will.
<unk> It's really wonderful to go, and also incredible power to work with creative people, clever and <unk>
And that's all right, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about my mind every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, you know, with each legs more thin and the most brilliant hair.
They only have to meet with a group models, because they have the legs and the brightest hair, the brightest hair and the <unk> but probably be the physically <unk> women on the planet.
But mostly it was difficult to analyze a situation of gender oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to hold out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since I was older enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 photos more <unk> and I didn't get me to the <unk>
There were no business directors, and there were no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, and even a little bit of good care.
In fact, most of them took tourists at random.
My story begins when I was in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of the <unk> and <unk>
He happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to pull the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take me back to New York on a <unk> journey, and you follow the <unk>
This is when we start to ask the tourists that they were going to take us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera at a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, never no one has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in a way that a young girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in October of October and to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always took the same picture, our approach changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how you perceive it with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all the year.
So recently, in one of the travel, we were walking around by walking, when all of a sudden, they stopped in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the fly's store that would take a little bit of previous <unk>
And he described me that I was five years old at that same place.
<unk> reminded me of his heart with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks in New York City are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in conscious creation.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't get out of a lot of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that gets the picture.
Today, I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't get out in front of you and ask somebody to ask someone and asked them a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the <unk> <unk> group.
First, why do they have so bad <unk>
It also has been associated with Disney laughs as well as a stupid silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the <unk> laughter, laughter, laughter, and <unk> these are the attributes that I associate with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't clean the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
They're hardly <unk>   You're far away from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.  There are two kinds of <unk> on this planet.
There's the <unk> of the New World that are mostly found in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World Wide Africa is where we have 16 species of extinction.
So why is the <unk> important -- first of all, provide vital ecological services <unk>
They're our <unk> <unk>
They get the ones <unk>
They help kill all the bacteria -- they help absorb the anthrax that they weren't going to spread and cause huge losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of <unk>
<unk> also have huge critical importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the Lagos and beneath Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian devil heads.
In the culture of <unk> they do some very important <unk> to open sky in places like <unk> there's no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a system of natural disposal system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities -- use this poison against predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of extinction, -- which means that in less than 10 or 15 years, and the reason is because they fall prey to the drug consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned by use in India and they've taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- you have a huge time bomb, and the number of soldiers has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up the <unk> lake.
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds. They cut it in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there is a horrible commerce commerce to serve <unk> and the market of <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, we're investigating these birds. We're <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on an online problem is not going to be at all.
We have to work with governments on the regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to their government and tell them we need to focus on these very pristine creatures -- their time to spread the word.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors about the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said it changed the opinion because he saw them fly without effort, without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorer without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do -- and everything that I make -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work for my youth in Africa.
<unk> to <unk> <unk> young -- but I am not.   I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the <unk> that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we would do is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people about country to grow food.
So we get to <unk> <unk> the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and teach the locals to grow churches and Italians and <unk>
Of course, people weren't at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were confident that the local, in so fertile valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
Yet instead of asking them how it was possible that we would not have any of all, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  You spend time to save the people from Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato sauce, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and <unk> the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say it? "You never <unk>
I thought only we were Italians to make mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, what the English did, and after seeing what the bodies were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least feed the <unk>
And we would see the <unk>   <unk> look at the waste that gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root of the Latin <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I try to deal with any of a different culture like my children, I want a lot."
I try to deal with all of the culture of a different culture like my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap on the face -- "I'm small <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a stick on the ground and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided the 27 years to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start nothing, you have never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do that? It <unk>
It will never come to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We sat down into a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is you going to do it?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for their own personal growth is the most important.
And then we help them find the knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting into a community to tell people what to do, why no, for a time, they were <unk> but not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never say, in a public meeting, what you want to do with your own money, what opportunity have they <unk>
So, planning is this blind.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know anything, because they don't have their public <unk>
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new profession.
The profession is a family doctor doctor -- the family doctor for the business of the business, which is set up with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen, and that helps you find the resources to transform his passion in a form of living.
I started this as a test in the city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to move away from this condescending <unk> where we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going, and the government came to me to see how you can do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very, very hard.
I was <unk> and <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of <unk>
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> business died to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the death of corporate spirit.
So now we have <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to conversation with you.
You have to offer you <unk> privacy, have to be great to the <unk> and then you will come up with the mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show you more of this tomorrow?
People <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneur spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- we are able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a form of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
<unk> government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a mining magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> this group of people got together this group of people, and <unk> what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not be within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk>  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States <unk> <unk> generic companies -- <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few times <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise they're not going to talk to you.
Then you have to offer you an absolute <unk> <unk> service.
And then you have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the biggest company, the biggest company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell to selling has got to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic financial management -- and you have to have a fantastic financial administration.
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that I can do, to sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This wasn't not born.
We have studied and observed the 100 icons of the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford -- Ford, all the new companies Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
And the word <unk> -- but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from an environment of small businesses that come out of a small business store in <unk> along with their dedicated <unk> who will make for you, what someone did by this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who is asking you, what will it?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can see it -- you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> that he looks at <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
<unk> around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, that's why we don't find a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects ask questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs today and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with giant <unk> who give shadow of <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
And that always gives you to the music.  There's a community in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest range of U.S. <unk>
I live near this house and I thought I could turn it into a very nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved that.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
Her death was suddenly sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and a lot.
And this was a deep amount of gratitude for the time lived and so on.
It gave it clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But let me keep this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to be able to get catching up the day to day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and painted on her phrases to <unk> "Before she died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day, the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die I want to be <unk>  Before I die I want to die on the line of change in the <unk>
Before I die I want to die for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside of <unk>
Before I die I want to save you once longer."
Before I die I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This space abandoned become constructive and the dreams and the hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about <unk> reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center we did a kit and now have made walls in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Central and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our era, it is more important than ever, to find ways to keep the perspective and remember that life is very short and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that we're getting more power.
And if you think about it in death -- our life.
Our spaces shared can reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help us improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
It doesn't speak, but it is transmitting joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's sharing <unk> what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and think about this: it's never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to tell the words I can't even be able to <unk> it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very <unk>
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
Yet, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we maintained when I was four years old, and I had my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though it would not consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing that was <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself differently, from there that will be so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that fast faster in the world, there is no cause no cure <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't look very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in line around the room, looking around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eating whatever the <unk>
As I was growing up, it would become more different, and the differences became more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> frustration and hyperactivity <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature, a very innocent nature of the world to see the world without biases, a human being ever <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they are things that wouldn't want to change it.
The normal passes through the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact that they will be different doesn't mean that one is wrong.
It just means that there's a different vision of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you, you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift in your inner inside, and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and the change dies at the moment in which we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what it must have been to be <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me a communications teacher, that I gave a communications class of engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> really <unk> from these students with their great minds, their big <unk> and the great unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what was <unk> must have felt like it fell to the black hole and saw the door of a new world.
And so I felt when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key thing to open up that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges from energy to the environment and health care and health care, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we didn't have any scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers aren't invited to see their amazing world.
So scientists and engineers, please go through <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply studying the <unk> but they study the <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing their science, carefully <unk>
The jargon is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't I say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> affordable is not the same thing that they make dumb <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, as Einstein, that everything is as simple as possible, but it doesn't simple.
They can communicate their science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories, stories, and analogies -- these are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting their job, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they call <unk>  What do you do the <unk> the bullets and kill, and they <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but that it's too supported in the language of the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
So the trick here is to use a simple <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then give you graphs that fit our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what it is <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help the rest of us open the door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the <unk> of the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that defined him so much better when he said, "A <unk> is that you find a public charge without any matter party party party or <unk> and that, when he won, you get it through the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to master language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that British Parliament, allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that they said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the rare name.
They put her into the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to face them, and at the end he had such a lot of such popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's <unk>
It's not. It's because of a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is being done in Congress for a long time.
We got all sorts of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and other people, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was to be tested by quality.
And not even with that was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given time.
And there might be <unk>
The whole world got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the daily newspaper every single <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
And what was made of <unk> and the <unk> was that the House House was against the <unk>
The House House didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it the King of it, and he would not want him to go to him or her old ideas.
And so they wanted to give her the most <unk> and the most unfortunate title that it came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invented the title -- no longer meant before, but it just meant <unk> which was <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were presidents <unk> of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it really was an meaningless.
And that is why the Senate gets burned.
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign and meet with <unk> <unk>
And who is going to take a serious title with a ridiculous title, <unk> like President of <unk>
And then finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as a President's degree.
President Barack Obama has lucky enough to go there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep them for <unk> years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and I want to tell you that the title of President of the U.S. doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to <unk> the largest economy of the world and a fleet of flying vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has endowed with the title of <unk>
So the end won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> -- well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that it's now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and what I'd like to do with you.
Politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually change reality, much more the words that what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet under land in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak -- but above all, this cacophony of male <unk> male and stones with <unk> tools.
Like each other, I carry a cheap amount of light -- I strapped into my head with this rubber rubber rubber and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that <unk> hole in the ground.
And my hand -- and I suddenly remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost control and dropped thousands feet on that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep part of that hole -- they risk her lives without paying a reward and often, and often, dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they might never will.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO which is dedicated to eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew there was in the world but not as a degree.
When we finished talking to me, I was honestly very sad, I was honestly trying to ignore this <unk> of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
It started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these sites.
A few people, even I considered them to be my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculus says there are over 27 million people in the world in the world.
It's twice as many African Africans throughout all of this is <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer farmer was about three times the annual salary of an American worker.
This is the equivalent of <unk> <unk>
And yet, today, you can enslave entire families to pay for 18 dollars for 18 dollars for 18.
Amazingly, slavery generates profits of over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false education promises for good education, and better job to find that they are forced to work without pay, low violence and cannot escape.
Today, slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
The slavery exists in most of the world, and yet it's illegal in the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the furnaces of bricks.
This strange <unk> show was like entering old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in an temperature of <unk> C, men, women, kids, in fact, families -- <unk> <unk> <unk> in a heavy overcoat of <unk> stack into their heads, to 18 at the time, and they carry them from the <unk> furnaces that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee breaks to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made that pee out pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the powder that my camera turned too hot to the touch, and let it work.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I thought, like, my camera receives a lot better than these people.
Back back in the furnaces I wanted to cry, but the <unk> that I was on my hand quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not citizenship in that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they already were.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his liberation and he trusted that he was <unk>
As to me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children <unk> rocks for miles per <unk> down to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids that charge them, and the kids would sell them to their heads with leg straps -- made out of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all their life.
They have nothing to do it.
When these villagers were <unk> their freedom, the <unk> they have completely <unk>
When you hear the word <unk> we often think about sexual trafficking, and because of the global awareness to me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
He led me to a set of stairs <unk> that gave this very dirty <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in my craft, they are local for <unk> <unk>
They have small rooms -- private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven years -- are forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each put is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
standing in <unk> I remember making sense of <unk> <unk> and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what it must be caught in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs.
There was no <unk>
There were no window enough to <unk>
These people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a very difficult topic -- it's important to point out that slavery even blood traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in Hindi, to the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families involved in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait of it.
The black hands of black are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My translator told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still don't hope, though, that we can go out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay us our job."
It's estimated there are over 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest ocean lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a family of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers -- some more young brothers -- makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families who have been forced to work <unk> extensive in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing to swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came to me was <unk> I was talking about her little canoe outside <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling in the water.
The <unk> branches of trees immersed in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, they get water to unleash the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
And for fear of his love, he doesn't go run and, like the whole life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is to the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they took the last networks, but they had been working on the one since a single day.
On the cold night and <unk>
And it fits that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a fishermen. village, they were rescued in a fishermen.
I met him in a refuge in which the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> partners the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his grandmother suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and touched the window.
He asked us to do it by a road road to the forest.
At the end of the way, we would get rid of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started to <unk> we took the <unk> that we put on the road and after walking around an hour of an hour of finding that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of pictures on my head as I put it into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
Many women had children tied up their back, and while they were looking for gold, they would go into <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they come out of the pump were embedded in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many of them had been underwater for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 90 meters, and these people have been carrying heavy stone bags that will then be attached to another area where the stone takes to extract the gold.
So the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer at the outside, we see the way to work with other fortunate and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up as this victim of T.B. and <unk> by <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him on mines.
By dying his uncle, I was able to inherit the debt of the uncle that force him to become the mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the mines and the lesion of the leg that you see here is the product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and, nevertheless, I was forced to work on night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dream of being liberated and educated with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this is this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility that inspires me a lot respect.
I want to shine light about slavery.
Did you know their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we would give testimony to them, and we will make everything possible to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can look at each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not <unk> These are real people, real people, like you, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I think I don't think of these so many beautiful, <unk> people that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these pictures will wake up a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force turns into a fire and that fire <unk> light over slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math math and there's a peculiar problem for whom we are <unk> we are like management companies.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the more human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the ballet <unk> and the dancers of <unk> -- that we will see later on.
But the testament to a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably some of the early <unk> that can have a genetic component.
Sadly, the neurologic disorders such as Parkinson's disease -- gradually destroy this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a ballet ballet <unk>
Over the last few years has gotten a lot of progress on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an <unk> <unk> <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers, That's why they don't serve blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological test.
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test they are?
You wouldn't need staff.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to propose to you as the conventional way to try, you see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the <unk>
It shows someone healthy when it emits sounds like speaking. We can imagine as dancers from a vocal queen, because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sound, and we all have the genes needed for example.
And as they did, it requires an amazing training.
Let's think of the time that it takes a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords position as they <unk> and as the Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
In the plot of the bottom of you can see an example of the <unk> identical <unk> of strings of <unk>
We see the same <unk>
E: <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more comfortable and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are precise <unk> but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're very low cost, and we all know what happens.
When something gets so <unk> it appears to mass scale.
These are some incredible goals to <unk>
We can reduce our patients <unk>
I would not have to go to the clinic for <unk> <unk>
<unk> monitoring we could get objective data.
We could do recruitment for low cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when we give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Women's <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines accessible for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, you can call it low price and leave recordings of a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all these samples of, say 10,000 people, you can say who you're healthy and who doesn't it?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. TR: Right.
<unk> You see, some people may not <unk> you may not have it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for <unk> the full markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have a <unk> precision at this time?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that works on the mobile phone network too, which is the project. We now have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I made <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are alien creatures gray.
We put ourselves in the dark, in no windows and, by the general, we avoid sunlight.
We make smaller models -- even more <unk> the perfect skin -- the perfect skin -- we do the impossible -- we can and we get them into the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience, and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that would happen in Japan.
Shortly later, an organization where he was <unk> there were <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the team of response.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th of May traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishing village located in the <unk> of <unk> of nearly 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The water level recorded over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers into the inside.
As you can imagine, the people was devastated.
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools, we took mud and leave the houses and leave ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We were terrified and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things like this.
They found pictures and pictures of pictures and cameras and chambers and <unk>
Everybody did the same thing.
You can take them and take them to different places in the villages of all around us.
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had anticipated.
As a <unk> of <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a center of <unk> people.
It helped clean the toilets <unk> gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and <unk> I had heard the expression thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going to go through myself my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some of you who had more than a hundred years -- some of them still were in the lab about the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl I had to get to have a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise, that little girl wouldn't have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as I have the photo <unk>
By the time of time, they came up by lucky time, and they took more pictures and they needed more <unk> this is that he walked back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people who were <unk> of <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a village neighbor to Northern <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in New York libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
So the time that we put in <unk> is a different story, dependent upon the course of the photos.
It could serve an hour. I could have a few weeks.
It could serve a few months.
This <unk> got to draw virtually by hand using the areas whose color and the detail of the water was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures in the water in saltwater, covered in bacteria, with algae, and even with <unk> all of it together next to the time I continue to <unk> that was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean, dry and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have the guidance of a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to hurt more the photos already <unk>
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to the photos.
He had started <unk> she was so stopped to realize that even more <unk>
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images from his husband and his own face would not have been able to be able to <unk> the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When I picked up their photos shared something from his story with us.
A few colleagues from his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble of the rubble far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues had it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find his entire family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her his pictures his younger son was coming up with 14 years old.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could go back to look at, something that I could remember the past of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan, 1,100 volunteers had joined up there <unk> hundreds of them were helped to clean up their hand more than <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the vast majority of their <unk>
Over 500 volunteers all over the world helped us back to 90 families and hundreds of completely <unk> and <unk>
For this time, we really don't spend over a thousand in teams and materials, most of the ink in <unk>
We take photographs all the time.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, one place, a relationship, a loved one.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take us but the first thing we would try to look for.
This was about the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to somebody their connection to the past.
When a picture like this gets back to somebody, it is a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger, to give back something, using their talent to something that are not direct models of perfect skin.
So I would just like to read this electronic email -- I sent him Cindy the day I went from Japan after six months.
While <unk> couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, <unk> around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my daughter <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but one billion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the interior of the body without using X-rays, and really challenging the camera.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it down and put it into a <unk> <unk> in a number of <unk> to create a package of photons of just one millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter of a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter in a millimeter of a millimeter in a millimeter in
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common <unk>
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and put it into this bottle, how do you spread those photons into this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember, this all happens in less than a <unk> is what takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with an photons package that starts <unk> and that, inside, start <unk>
Part of the light goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
In that time, your waves travel down the table and because of the insights on the top of the top of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights would be <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current and we make it <unk> the same distance and we see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us sit down to see that movie?
One day? A week? Actually, a week?
It would be a very boring film --  of a slow bullet of motion.
And what about trying to test with nature <unk>
You can see the waves that were <unk> from the table and the tomato wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look more and more of this <unk> you realize that, as the light sits out of the <unk> it's still bright.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces back into your interior and comes back after several <unk>
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to touch it.
What do we create this camera in the <unk>
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture to the exhibition, it comes very little light away.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest one: so you can barely get some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, million times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those pieces of data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data into crude and sort of interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can become invisible.
And if a new power of the future would be allowed to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door -- let me go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera, to the camera,
Where we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons will go back to the chamber but interestingly, at slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capabilities.
It has very good time resolution. And it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the <unk> objects but we don't know what point it is to a distance.
So projecting a laser can be shot in a <unk> picture, which you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we're going to gather them and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we will be able to see the object coming in.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's on the way around the curve,
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light light reflected by the open windows around.
Or we could build <unk> capable of looking at the interior of the body using <unk> and the same for <unk>
But, of course, because of the tissue and blood is pretty difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new sector of visualization to solve the problems of surveillance on next generation.
And as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, I became science in art, an art of photographs of <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data we collected is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see that we can see.
So creating a new form of computer photography with slow motion and <unk>
And let's look at those waves. Remember, the time between each of those waves is just about <unk> <unk>
But here's also a lot of fun.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> these are going off from us.
The waves should move towards us.
So what happens here?
It turns out that as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order when the events happen in the world sometimes is going on to the camera.
And we have the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's already time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> your life, and you give you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
You can tweet a mobile message and start a protest in Egypt.
So with a cell phone, you can record a song, put it to <unk> and become famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to look for change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these <unk> people who would come up with a change, had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who are you having a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Hands up your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, a <unk>
It's a lot. Most of you have a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about me, from my mobile, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 different lines of information.
Data data.
Why is that information that is there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission on the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European phone company, every single Internet monopoly in all Europe, has to store a whole range of data range from users.
Who's called <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years old, in their phone company or his Internet provider or their Internet.
And all over Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this database.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone and the Internet providers, and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, and they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets in the Berlin streets and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be military 2.0.
<unk> was the secret police of Eastern <unk>
And I also asked myself if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> that at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, that for favor of all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went to ask her, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a judicial lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give this information.
At the end of you, I mean, you know.
And they would raise demand and they sent me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly layer with a CD in it.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> -- 30 thousand <unk>
At the beginning I saw it, and I said, well, it's an enormous file.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I was at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the data retention means.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom up and try and go back and forward.
You can see every step I take,
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk about a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call them between them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one, and we ended up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other, what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who sends an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And so a result, neither is the fall of <unk>
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible in and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility of going to follow our lives and want to take them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today, you have to fight for self-determination.
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go back home, tell your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value and it's not even though it's fashion.
When you go home, tell your representative that just because business and state agencies can store some information, you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store of you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phone that you can remember that you have to fight for <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different addresses -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why they were <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
The C. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> and it's not <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were a brothers, but they are.
It's just by accidents, like the one that happened to me at birth.
Now, I'm going to show you, I'm not a source of inspiration, and I don't want any of you in the present line.
It feels bad for me, because at some point of life, you've wanted to be a disabled person.
Let's go for a walk.
So Christmas in the mall are in the commercial center, you drive in circles for parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
Also, I say, I've got 99 problems, and the C. <unk> is just one of them.
There are a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, lived and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you probably should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial age.
I also love that if I'd like to walk from my home to New York City, you could.
Many people with cerebral <unk> not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you get me <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> I was <unk>
If my three sisters were going to public school, my parents would go to the school system, and they would stop that I was going, and if I didn't take all the most of the most <unk> my mother.
My father taught me how to walk at five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
So another approach I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that he <unk>
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in kindergarten was walking like an <unk> champion that has gotten a lot of taps.
By growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family.  I think no one realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a campaign.
The people that I grew up with didn't have trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of a lot of a lot that die of hunger during the <unk>
I was saying that he had enough fat to live three months without eating three months without eating, so <unk> at dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I would too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer summer on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers of myself in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we didn't go to Palestine all the <unk> we would wake up in <unk>
On the summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> so I got me <unk> warm cups on the back, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember, <unk> <unk>
But the silver cure was the yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before doing yoga was a comedian of <unk> that he couldn't stand up with <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents, I was able to do anything that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant for the State of the Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like <unk> pet theater department.
I all <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took the ultimate note at my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I made a scene from the glass Bay of my <unk> teachers.
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I've got <unk>
At the end of <unk> I finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running on the director of the theater, crying over the department, crying as if somebody had killed my cat, to ask him why and she told me that because they thought he couldn't do the risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do any risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a piece of paper that he literally had been born and gave a actress without cerebral <unk>
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
At <unk> I went home, and my first tour, <unk> was like a <unk>
My dream became reality.
And I knew that it would be <unk> <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than <unk> and it was clear to me that principals <unk> not <unk> any <unk> <unk> not white, with disabilities.
You just take perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I became <unk>
On my first tour, I took Peter <unk> New York to New Jersey and never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he fell at high speed by the New Jersey freeway with a driver who had cerebral <unk>
I worked in <unk> across the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, no <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know they never heard that little nasty rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find it very fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the New York Festival of New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and I'm going to remind the directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of stigma for disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program <unk> cable <unk>
And I walked out as if I went to a graduate dance, I went back to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the <unk> and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, go!
And we were in <unk>
So I clinging to the speaker desk so not going out of the screen during the <unk> and when the interview ended up -- I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they would not come back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was just like <unk> full-time participant and beat my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that children are <unk> but they never <unk> from me and a little bit of older people.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
I saw clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What a disease is that?
We should really pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't do the <unk> then you can't make anybody in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I had grown up with media, but I don't think it would happen.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, it will make it less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got <unk> by the red carpet -- by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in the large state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> <unk> a charity to give the children Palestinian refugees -- a bit of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me live in alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
My name is <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child from a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know your story.
He lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives the little village to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
No one for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no job, no <unk>
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he was about a guy who offers him to take it to <unk> after dinner for dinner, to <unk>
Let's take a dynamic from a bunch of people, which gives you a break.
He gets a little bit of money to get new clothes, money to send home to your family.
You show a young lady.
Finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a bomb.
That child from that little boy with dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were in the <unk> an organization terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how a story of a child from a little boy trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future, and this was the first thing that she arrived.
This was the first thing that pulled it out of what we call the <unk> <unk>
And its story is repeating it in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the modern urban <unk> unemployed <unk> riots in <unk> riots in London, which are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of city is the opportunity, of jobs, for well-being, but the young people are not participating in the prosperity of their cities.
Often the youth who suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities -- the history of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, violence, to <unk> will be the story of communities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not going to school.
They don't do pretty much nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember standing in front of that hospital <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had seen myself forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor some juvenile leaders.
<unk> about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had the rain of ideas about solutions to the great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because he was a graduate graduate college -- frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle may be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What makes this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think that business spirit may be the most powerful tool against <unk> of <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so warm.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was invited to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years ago, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were of plastic sent from abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of you who grew up during civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he began to cultivate <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers and she started creating gardens in the homes, and the city companies and now is working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, young people, can go together, and, as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he is not growing <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is inspire young people, and in that room, the Mohamed presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought of starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, who might be <unk> from change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, we inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit -- it's really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to <unk> in the development of their business.
They need young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from learning to the creation, to create the <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating social impact.
Mohamed not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Park of <unk> this is how he called, when it's created, transforming the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and keep <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape from <unk> <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and they have more stories about flowers and <unk> from the Peace that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains of the <unk> area in the north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the path that we could -- we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> giant <unk> balls.
And he was <unk> he was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they thought was going to be able to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and you get a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where they <unk> the <unk> who clean our garbage in <unk>
Who clean our garbage in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> cleans our trash, and of 11 tons of waste and waste of waste and two tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go on.
So I started working as <unk> <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in trucks. I don't just travel in trucks.
And he <unk> the mechanical <unk> and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevailing as you believe, and in the days that it is very strong -- you want to make it very quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years, and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of getting on their body tons every week.
There's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Nuclear <unk> the waste collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and moving into traffic all day and pass across the day and moves around you.
They just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about cutting the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is as a force of nature itself.
You never stop coming.
It's also like a kind of breathing or circulation.
It's always due to movement.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important work in the streets of town, for three reasons.
They're the first protective of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient way and effective every day, this starts to flow from their container and its dangers inherent to us in very real forms.
And that we had controlled for decades, and centuries and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for what the genes of the economy begin to fail when it is at danger of the consumption is.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, and I'm just making your relationship.
And then what I call our average speed we need.
With that, I mean simply at the speed that we used to move used to move in the time.
We usually don't care about it, and we did not have our coffee cup or take our cup of coffee, our bag of water.
We use them, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side to take out of it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about waste waste that maybe help to reduce the stigma and focus on that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Their work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when we <unk>
And their work allows us to make our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us except for ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection of waste on the street, grabbed my son and went down the stairs and he went down the stairs and there was a man making his piece of paper <unk> as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be good."
Shortly after that, I started to investigate waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have to include and have to account all the costs, even the very real human cost.
The municipal waste, what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one that you see someone whose job is to clean the garbage of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life in our communal life where architecture is naturally born of conditions and local traditions.
Today, I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example began with an invitation to design a shopping center for several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, my team and me, about what we had to design with.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to spend a lot of energy because the coating with crystals generates heat into the interior, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city that this shouldn't happen because it is a temperate climate that's 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And thirdly, what it looks like is nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> for a place so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure in the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a <unk> building building, apply these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the <unk> the site, which is located in an area of much growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating in a hundred feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, assembling all the inputs of the building.
And this is running out of a <unk> <unk> which creates an outdoor space in the building which is <unk> by its own way, in the sun and rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes every floor because of the space of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would bring the local economic condition.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a concrete <unk> in <unk> to allow the air air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we inspire us in these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model it.
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled by the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use light from the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it wasn't what they were doing.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was actually going to be much more profitable than the mall because in the end of the bank there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was so much more economic, not only because of the material compared to glass, but also because it no longer need to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a great advantage by putting it into the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of gathering and bars that would create this oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, that they collect water for the <unk>
It's waiting for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction floor.
The second example is a master plan of 2000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project that big, the biggest project that I have designed, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also his environment, his tradition and culture.
And during that analysis, I put special attention on the <unk> a <unk> structure of <unk> which was surrounded by a wall with a dozen access access connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets and the existing streets -- creating 12 initial building blocks in size and features in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some points in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changes the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell project, as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, which would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilated, so much of the house.
So we put a scheme to make sure that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these <unk> blocks and then in the low plant we have all the connections to them.
And it also responds to local norms that set up greater density at higher levels and low density in the plant down.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving us a community to the space busy the construction of construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and go up and do activities like running a two miles in the morning, or to jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same pace as the buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important looking at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as a target to connect nature to the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had very bright hair and very bright hair and a small <unk> of cute. It was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was filled with <unk> until I <unk> my sinister plan.
I was a day after at the time after the school out of school, I was a little afternoon, and I was amazed at the bathroom of the girls.
And when the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher grades.
And then I did.
I get the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a little bit.
All of the such one --  And I set out to bring back the book to <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had really good grades as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of the rows of <unk> and myself a row in a row just to be there, because I was there.
I'm still amazed at what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good at doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all obvious <unk>
I never <unk>
But above all, I would tell you the reason why I would bother to tell me that this little girl so small, it was so good for me.
I had jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause for birth families in the United States.
And yet, I have never seen a study that will benefit the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
And so you have to go to fiction, because the novels are like the laboratory that we study them in all their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if I had no <unk> there would be literature.
Well there would be no <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
It wouldn't have Shakespeare.
And I went through high school lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> almost that they have all of them.
This year was about 100 years of his masterpiece, "In the search of time, I was looking for the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> my own, all that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details, <unk> right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget how hard that image.
We forget how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as a cat.
I don't know how it's <unk> of cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious that the <unk> that are reduced to the person, their wish, to their <unk> are a <unk> narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
One story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details to be able to put up the <unk> right?
<unk> make all novelists <unk> and that's something I would have understood that.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure to another, maybe right now.
And it starts to be said to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every single cool thing that <unk> detects in his lover -- he adds it to his collection of instruments of torture in their private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work, right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> they like the vast amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> got out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well in the language of the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of suddenly listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're a real scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search of truth, a really painful <unk> in fact, to what to <unk> <unk> the more it is better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> these were the tracks of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs us experience, it causes us to make a range of much more profound feelings and vital that a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we will go to search for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> teaches us ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us open up in this particular way.
There's some other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Or some other emotion that teaches us to look at how they <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young man who was consumed with the idea that her woman was <unk>
And Freud says that there was something weird in that man, which was not <unk> on what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that was doing his wife, without realizing it <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally they were <unk> with a man?
Freud say that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
The novels, <unk> really well how the <unk> make us look with intensity but without accuracy.
In fact, the most intensely <unk> we are, the more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent or illegal acts of it.
<unk> drive us to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself at the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
One woman of Michigan from 52 years old was captured by having created a false account on Facebook since the one that was sent <unk> <unk> for a year.
For one year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How massive, even though we change creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel. <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very rare and brilliant character from American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that deal with how the <unk> <unk> our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to take away from your self and <unk> that you ever <unk> and it's under the floor -- you get your name, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the road of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as much as I want.
It's a shame, because we live in times by envy.
We live in a times.
I mean, we are good citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what characters always do when they're not secure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about the curse of <unk> at Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always got a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but he does it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs your help, but you get it, and you put it up with <unk> in each of the mysteries.
But how do they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you go into <unk> all with his solution, <unk> goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> that I wouldn't want to shake your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in the story. It seems to me very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat them as a problem of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute are the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could it be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be related to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to be <unk> from the greatness in the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk>
So as we expect that happens, we remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Just <unk> <unk> jealousy.
<unk> the <unk> the invites the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the terrifying one, Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the very Marcel Marcel <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 2012, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but his presence in the gray surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest epidemic in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 businesses, universities and government agencies.
They died -- including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on its surface, of which throwing the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we find?
They didn't brought a lot of <unk> kilograms of old rocks, and something that 24 kilometers later, a new sense of the <unk> and fragility in our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that the president Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> -- some ask, why do you <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And they could also ask, why scale the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why do you fly over the <unk>
Why do you play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the wonder of the <unk> of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in an context of a long list of technology list.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> <unk> and eliminated smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles / hour.
Since 1970s, no human being has gone back to the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> by seeing that we imagine that we imagined the technology that we imagined how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure the cancer, or to feed the global population seem to be <unk>
I remember looking at the <unk> of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't go to the escape escape.
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely confident that I would have seen the colonies on Mars.
So this is what it happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have met us and have enriched with trivial toys -- things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that you have created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years when you were on <unk>
Silicon Valley, which is that markets are the guilty, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs to.
Silicon Valley, he says that the risk investment caused the creation of ideas <unk> by the funding of <unk> <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly is going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the capitalists of risk were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they were going to make small investment, little investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing with the benefit of technologies like energy, which need massive capital and development in the long term. They also haven't invested in the development of technologies dedicated to solving large problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we cannot solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve big problems.
We could go to Mars if you look at it.
NASA's even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that would be popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to Mars because everybody thinks there are things important to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because the political systems have fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption is from renewable energy from renewable energy as solar, wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic <unk>
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind and oil and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that they can compete for price on price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree on what policies and international <unk> the development of a <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope for the current political climate that we're going to see an American policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that looked like technological, turn out not to be.
We know from time that famines are a result of failure in the food <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and <unk> but will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon was described to the war in 1971, but we soon found that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to be found quite effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we cannot solve the problems with technology.
We can and we need -- but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must be able to support the <unk> it must really be a problem with us, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, it meets those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> hard and dangerous and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And actually, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't miss the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, it's a very general belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a job, which I think gives you a clearest idea about that.
First, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It leads me to think that may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that might have increased in others.
I'm not really sure.
But I can turn to opinion polls and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at your opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep inspiring the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years is still a lot of <unk> judges, judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen.
But is this evidence enough?
What polls opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you see is the generic attitudes that people reproduce when you ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
You probably ask for asking, "To do what?"
And that would be a very sensible response.
And you could say, when you've told your question, "Well, I trust you, but in other no."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust in the form of <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> official or a person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, to say I trust a certain degree of elementary school I know to give you the class, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to maintain a conversation, but no, maybe to save a secret.
Simple.
And if we come up with those evidence in our everyday lives in the way trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in more <unk>
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real trust level, because they try to engage the good judgment in fact to trust something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the target I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it is.
In short, I'm <unk> not to trust what it is not reliable.
And I think that those people who shine their savings with the very rightly named Mr. Madoff, that then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say it says, yes, that's what it means is that what matters is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is to make a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find a person is going to be competent people, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust her, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible -- we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest -- but not <unk> in them to bring a letter to the post, because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very confident that you can do certain things, but I see that they will make their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are relevant and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If so, I still have no <unk>
But that's what we're going to be interested in <unk> before trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to judge.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build <unk> systems for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that they made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that I would go through childbirth in <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we found that the accountability system that is destined to ensure <unk> and evidence of <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do difficult tasks, like <unk> <unk> which are <unk> as we say.
You must all know the similar examples.
And so we put all of that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if they were worthy of trust and <unk> the people that we are reliable and if other people, officials are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the judgment, simple action, the <unk> what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task reconstruct the confidence, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if it's two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately, it is a signature because we give us some other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough for you to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't care about all people, all the time.
But you also have to give them <unk> evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is done every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks said that I can return them back without <unk>
I carry them and get me the money, or they change it by the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you are worthy of trust, and you have trust what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing out is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of the computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that imagination can be <unk>
This separation has become increasingly increasingly increasingly and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
I started imagining how we <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that is going into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to <unk>
Designers can tap their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs below the screen.
So with this tool they break the barriers.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of the hands?
In the <unk> Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard on a digital <unk>
You know, a see-through bombsight with cameras to detect the fingers and the face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, reach inside the 3D space, and grab the pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space -- it's as easy as to grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight the <unk> or the words with the virtual tactile sensor that there are the bottom of every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we are going to be interested in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
And so many of us would have bought and forth, things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make them physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would you be a <unk>
At the MIT Media Lab, I had my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, this only physical one.
So this magnet magnet, is behaving as a pixel or in 3D in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control motion by a combination of magnetic levitation -- and a combination of <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and become reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and physically and the famous shot by Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality sometimes we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's most fascinating to change the physics of computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you can see, digital information will not only show us something but start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us having to get rid of our world.
We started talking today about a barrier, but if we suppressed that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to join a school for athletes with all expenses payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed firmly that there was just a <unk> path towards <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter whether the job I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera, Chinese China.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young people to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would tell you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was already too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
I thought that during the rest of my life a second class of second class was the only thing to aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to be <unk> OK.
They went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> I got to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I do here?
Those were in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's one issue for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
And so it became my tool to go out of this fall <unk> and to <unk> the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my habit of reading <unk>
It was a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning of this map I found it out of place because this is what students in China will learn.
I would never have happened that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of the people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There are up to research fields as comparative religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading was working to research, why don't we do it also on day lives.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic economic and <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> <unk> fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk>
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like <unk>
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have been <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of sleep.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, of where the dreams, of where the passion of where happiness comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy to live again with purpose and clearly most of the time.
So the books always are <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, in Berkeley.
She was a woman in 26 years called <unk>
Alex entered the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on the couch of my office <unk> and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like first customer.
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> and it made me easy to move the head and get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and so I would see, she was right.
You start working after that, then he has children later, and then the death goes on.
For <unk> as Alex and I had plenty of time.
But shortly after, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming out with guys underneath his category, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> but it's not like she went to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said no, but maybe <unk> with the next one.
Also, the best time to work in marriage of Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were <unk> but this didn't make that <unk> of Alex were a pause in their development.
This made that <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
And then I realized that this kind of benign <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for race careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million customers in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent -- if you think no one comes to age without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take away the dream of a <unk> I want to see. It's good.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to 35 years.
This means that eight out of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments <unk> that give their life to life will have gone for when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> people who don't panic.
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half the Americans are married, and they're coming out with their future partner for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and the last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change itself, now is the moment to change it.
We know the personality.
<unk> are the time to take care of their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which its everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who was <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called an adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the customers are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of time of adulthood.
Researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
It's not happening.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it's absolutely nothing.
And then every day every day, intelligent, interesting things like you or your children and daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this <unk> I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a race before 30, everything will be good."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better read the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game game.
They were all running and <unk> but then somewhere around 30, the music turned out and all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was going to be standing, so I sometimes think I was married with my husband because he was the nearest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds like a little bit of it, but it is not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to 30 and so many of them to start a career, choose a job, pick a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
And so many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything from once the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
You see, you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he doing? What was I <unk>
I want to change what the customers are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
<unk> Emma came to my office because I was in his own words, having an identity.
He said they would like to work in art or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living <unk> very difficult, your previous life had been even harder.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then she would rise up as he said, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day, she got his head over his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book to <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with her many <unk> but then he looked at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> for <unk> for <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if I give me <unk>
At that time, I took a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What she needed was not a <unk> that really was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the 1950s.
So for the next few weeks, and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that you get from that identity of identity and the capital of identity.
By identity capital, I mean to do something to add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the race of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital creates capital of identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that they want to try to try to it.
I'm not <unk> exploration exploration, I'm <unk> exploration that shouldn't count, by the way, it's not exploration, that by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I told Emma who urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> are come together with friends with similar minds are limited in terms of who you know, what you know -- how they think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who is coming out almost always comes from outside of the <unk>
The new things come from what they call weak ties for friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no, the weak links are the form of <unk> this group.
Half of the jobs created never <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma will soon go back to his family, when they have a partner and we form his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think the 30 is better age to sit down that 20 or even the 25 and I agree with you.
But we choose the person that you live now or you <unk> now when everyone on Facebook begin to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it will work or killing time with anybody that you would give you to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate at a prime of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link was helped to get a job there.
That job of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend who alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married with a man who chose does.
<unk> his new career, loves her new family, and I send me a letter to say, "Now the spaces of online contacts are not <unk> enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like airplanes that come out from Los Angeles, and Los Angeles, that come somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> light in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good conversation -- a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the years or even the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all of the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to tell you to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling you to <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get capital of identity, using their weak conditions, choose your family.
Don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't have.
They're deciding your life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job at management management management at a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach you mathematics to <unk> students in the public schools in New York City.
And as any teacher, they are testing tests and tests.
I give assignments.
When the work comes back, I get grades.
What struck me was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of them who had a better performance had no scores of <unk> I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of the students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure in better ways.
It's the <unk> but what if it's successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of scenarios. And in every study, my question was, who is success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> Academy <unk>
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children <unk> as far as possible at competition.
We studied teachers who are working in neighborhoods really difficult -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and of <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the outcomes of their <unk>
We teamed up with private companies, which of these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, came a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to reach very long-term goals.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> is embracing your future, day after day, not just a week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not at all.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students that made my questionnaires <unk> and then waited for about a year to see those who were <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination were significantly more likely to graduation, even when the <unk> in every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of testing tests -- even the security that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about <unk> is how little of science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How long do you deal with children?
What do I do to teach kids a very cool work <unk>
How do they keep them for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent is not <unk>
Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals that they simply don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, <unk> commonly isn't related or even related to the measurements.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that <unk> a permanent condition.
So the growth mentality is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our intuitions in the strongest and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, <unk> to start all again again with the lessons that we have.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother, the form and the shape of the Chinese characters.
From that time, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a abroad, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
So over the last few years, I've been wondering if I can bring down this <unk> so that you might want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language that I can do so.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes in every character on the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and faster.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand the basic crisis.
The first 200 will allow them to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read signs of traffic, menus <unk> understand the basic idea of the web pages or newspapers.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was shouting at <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> by the shape of the called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The Moon.
The <unk> symbol looks like a couple of doors in the old West <unk>
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two is company, three are crowd.
If one person stretches his arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations there.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a single tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember the fire?
Two <unk> together, it becomes very hot.
Three feet together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the shining moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a chart inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out hidden from one gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, getting care is <unk>
So we've gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method -- the first eight radical <unk> will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters to build others 32.
So with every small effort, they will be able to learn a couple hundred <unk> which is the same as you learn a Chinese Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the <unk> we start creating sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun put up with the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun together with the beginning, created Japan.
One person in Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the diaspora has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician together.
The movie mastered his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic wand
But when you look at that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of an industrial complex of child's fantasy play.
However, the magician of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't begin that trend.
The trend really took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> boy would hold a girl dressed as the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there is very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive as the <unk>
But I think if the magician magician was done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> magic shoes to beat the military <unk> by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing about the magician. of Oz is that the smartest characters and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I did see Star Wars a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance was <unk>  so slid in the room and he was impressed like a mom with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> resilience and <unk>
It should be a sense that Luke give one military to overthrowing the government?
So let's put this with the magician in the <unk>
How could Dorothy his movie?
We do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to you, right? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much force capital force in the movies for our kids, and so little on the road of <unk> bricks path.
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence films in the girls, and they should be <unk> it's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that Princess <unk> doesn't provide the appropriate framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment of first <unk> I really expected the teacher to come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is over, I have a girlfriend.
Why do you stand there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on defeat <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be an <unk> animal, and if you're a girl, you have to wear a <unk>
There's a lot of exceptions, and defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they, kids, they are not really their goal.
They do a fantastic job by teaching girls how to defend themselves against <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how they defend from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all time continues to appear in classic in classic <unk> each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raised a girl.
And as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie from a <unk>
It's pretty good. Don't let that be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films the test <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not the roots and it will be wrong, but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book book and in the <unk> '80s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of mine on the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that have been <unk> in the movie, there's more of a female character than <unk>
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the kid than you like it?  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
I have seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the movie we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good <unk> film, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a thought of consensus from what is a movie Hollywood film.
<unk> is not the test of <unk>
And I don't think I would take it out, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the movie is happening in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the fishing crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful and painful in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Get the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's put it in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 most popular movies -- how many of them believe they have actors <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen in Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a larger number that goes to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one of every five women in the United States, it has been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I believe that music music or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What don't they get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero, is to beat <unk> with violence, and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very attractive statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools for our willingness to <unk> <unk> and we hope that we have to ask, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> it goes to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite character from Star Wars you know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these <unk>
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where you see their job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I liked was to look at sea crackers because my parents told me that I would give me lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand, and it's hard to see them.
Yet over time, I was invited to <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of about 1.3 miles of length with the <unk>
And my sea Sea had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
So I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern Delta.
And the place, in simple view, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using fake color, the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we have used the satellite data to find an ancient city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient Egypt capital for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle East about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman East, there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge freezing of <unk>
This area is immense, it's about <unk> per <unk>
Now, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered all the city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'm going to find out the random that would be the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with the eyes -- and using baseball <unk>
So, we use NASA imaging to make a map of the place, with a very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where it was <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborate with scientists by doing labor jobs, you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample of shows in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five feet down, below a thick thick layer of Amazon, we found a dense layer of objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation in several hundred years that date from the Ottoman East, exactly the same period as we think it's <unk>
We also found jobs of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a jewelry shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Ottoman Empire, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that dates back the Middle East in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry workshop that shows that what I've been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but <unk> the place in the near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Roman Empire, probably was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to TED, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually actually started in 1984 B.C. <unk> in a missing city not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts out of marine <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door of <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that it's made.
Now we had a group of <unk> obese <unk>
They're racing in a <unk> race, and they go in direction to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of your house.
There are bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that go on their side, rays from the wheels that end up in places that end up in <unk> places the threshold of the gate,
And then the lobby, or what's on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
They're waving with my hand.
From his chair on a brown horse ...
It's a horse we're talking about.
You can feel your blue <unk> by doing their nose.
You can smell the census <unk> and you have to get a little bit about getting into the mouth.
They went on on one side and go to your living room.
In the room, and doing maximum use of its imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He is with little clothes, dancing over his <unk> singing <unk> singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now I go to the kitchen.
The soil has been coated with a yellow road road and from the oven coming to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, <unk> to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that is done every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a Hindu journalist, I guess, that this was as the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of a few different ages ladies and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, looking at them just once.
<unk> the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
<unk> poems just in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people must be nature's phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk> memories.
I said, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who deals with this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using <unk> <unk> techniques in Greece, and the same techniques that we used <unk> to memorize their narratives and that the medieval academics used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I not hear this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competence, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English English and a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I would like to teach it to Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a <unk> <unk> and national TV face.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start a little not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey, for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that he didn't even remember that he had a problem with <unk> it's amazing.
Somebody was incredibly tragic, but it was a window to allow us to see how our memory makes us we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent a afternoon in the public library from Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And on the back, I read a bunch of treated about the memory written over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having a disciplined memory and disciplined memory was not such a rare thing as you can look like today.
So a long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
And we have changed the verge and I would say that they have changed our cognitive <unk>
As we almost have no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where we are still passionate people in this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a team from University College London invited a group of memory champions into the lab.
They wanted to know -- it will have some brains in some structural way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a <unk> battery battery and the answer was really not.
There was yet a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI MRI machine, <unk> your brains as it <unk> numbers, <unk> faces and forms of snow. They found that in the memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or seemed to <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is driving as a armed race where every year shows someone with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> which he is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
Yes. Yes.
And while there is a huge amount of ways of remembering things on these competence, absolutely all the techniques used to the end of the <unk> to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It is illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says, "I say two people who remember the same word -- I say to two people who remember the same word.
That's his name.
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them, <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
So what do you do?"
The person who said that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who said that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that is weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, really doesn't mean anything for you. It has no relationship to you.
with all the other memories that dance in their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk> <unk>
They have flour <unk>
<unk> when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when we put that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some further back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is two and a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet named <unk> who did a <unk>
They had hired like entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up, <unk> his memory poem and <unk> and as soon as it was, the <unk> room was <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed all of us, but it ripped the bodies into <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting there.
So you couldn't get the <unk>
It's a tragedy behind the other.
I was standing outside, only survivor, in the <unk> of the rubble, shut down the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had sitting every day.
He took the family of the hand back to where his loved ones were in the rubble.
What we <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know about or less <unk> and is that no matter whether we are not good at remembering names or phone numbers word for the word for our colleagues, we have visual memory and remarkable spatial memory.
If I tell you that the first 10 words of the story I've just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet if you would tell you who he was sitting on the horse straight in his lobby, you would be able to <unk>
The idea of the women's palace is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember. The more crazy -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image more likely to be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do the memory -- the same way that he would have done it -- if you had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of image of it, absolutely ridiculous, crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine them going into your house, and see the <unk> of <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then they would see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote <unk> that you want to count.
And then they turned into the kitchen, and the fourth theme that they would talk to be that strange journey that they made for a whole year, and you have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how <unk> speakers <unk> their narratives -- not word for word, which is going to confuse but, typical per typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in its <unk>
I saw this was simply fascinating, and I got up with it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something extensive about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
But seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets on the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every single day, before I sit across the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school school kid in a market of <unk>
And I found that this was fun.
I'd never expected it to be.
It was fun, because it wasn't just training memory.
What is actually about doing is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was pretty excited about this.
This is me, using my standard team of training for the memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and a few pounds of security covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before I had the idea that I could go online, in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might be good <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to memorize narratives and <unk> and a phone phone and ready shopping, but actually this is not the point.
These are so just tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to put it to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit with a little bit of insight, about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories is <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory skills, are just shortcuts.
In fact, it's not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them are not <unk> out there.
But the reality is there is no shortcuts.
That's how things become <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what I <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I let me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is our short-term existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to being human in front of us, who is going to be so <unk> that we don't even care about process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we just <unk> just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> and I was <unk> and I was six years old, and I lived there at home from my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom to share with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And then everybody spent the TV, so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everyone looked at me, and every time I turned it up, and I would come back up and wrapped up in a towel, everyone saw me.
And I was like that.
It was <unk> not really.
I took that tour, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or <unk> but of those connections, emotional connections, which we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel that way, because according to the EPA in the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
That means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it as being based on a building a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> who used architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we built our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build museums of art.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build homes.
Look, these <unk> stable, solid, in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are doing the <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that you know are going to work.
So we met buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the <unk> Public Library that ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> has this round place, red brick -- that they leave <unk> what it <unk> is to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of ownership, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, ended up with another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year in the same country, two buildings, both called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that are constantly producing new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms today.
And we were going to do so much and we talked so much that we get away from the people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead in because we have no choice.
We have to go to the other side and come back to connect with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started experimenting with <unk> we do swing the porch to go ahead and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago in the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small <unk>
Really hard.
So we're approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the self again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added bake and we use a new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took hundreds, and we turned them into <unk> that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes were <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But they were the '80s, that's great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic erotic lives.
These fantasies could be <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of <unk>
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, because they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we started recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and all of you know this is not <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects are frustrated with frustrated and we started to swing the next again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we have new <unk> design techniques -- and we find ourselves with new <unk> some shapes that were <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's <unk> You have completely <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> and public <unk> were completely agreement on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> construction.
<unk> in Bilbao increased in a 2,500 percent when they ended the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild and radical ways, how is it possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the means <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction to these forms.
The same did the primary mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennium, happened to another star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually starting to happen with all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Imagine, for example, how they use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a ship -- a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we all are photographers from architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now -- that means that the speed of communications eventually has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast as well.
It doesn't just spend a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before we know if which I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we met buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we didn't have any idea how much people are.
That will never happen.
My theory is that when it applies to media to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until it will be in both extremes almost in <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and <unk> among us, the architects, and you, the public.
We can now make symbols almost with emotional payload, something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building which is <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like exactly the done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that one made the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with our collective memory, and by putting these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell us each other about architecture, because digital media not only changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building evolved today, first <unk> the Internet looking for <unk> <unk>
You get bombarded with examples of experiment with innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell them that there is no unique answer to what was a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and drawings -- and one is no longer an <unk> audience who doesn't have seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't take care of the architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one way to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical <unk> historical brick with ideas of what was the <unk>
This means that some robots can build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for ways that are going to make.
That means that the buildings are attached to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking lot in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sports or to <unk> or even you can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream in the East Side of New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the community around that cause, no longer is a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going observe.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we are no longer on opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give them a way to the <unk> spaces -- local libraries where the homes we form our children, and the step in the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does that this great way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that we like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his mirror image.
They <unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all his friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and I was thinking, when couple of doing this?
How do we suddenly be taste with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as a teenager, it just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday for night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's got a little bit confused -- it's a little confused because even though his mom tells you all the time she is beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
Among your mom tells him and what his friends or school friends say, you don't know who they believe.
So it does a video of her, he puts it on YouTube, and ask others that please leave a <unk> "I'm pretty <unk>
Well, far, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> they don't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a regular healthy teenager and normal and who receives these answers in one of their most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate in this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, teenagers in today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young as young people.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your bedroom all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, being connected to being connected to our children to <unk> based on the volume of liking it and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it's not.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is folded <unk>
What is the biggest thing in somebody's life in front of someone in front of what is normal in a everyday context of a day?
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of the girls now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> are still dominating our <unk>
<unk> <unk> is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of that <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see how young the young people are.
But the kids are neither immune to this.
Like the superheroes of the superheroes of sports and the singers, <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we surely want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and thinking to their appearance, to the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capacities. their studies and other ways they start to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
These are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings, and how we deal with society and the developing field.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class.
One in five are not <unk> at all during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think that you look good enough, specifically if you don't think you're enough enough -- you take a lower note at the average of your fellow who don't care about that appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it's given irrespective of what they weigh these young young.
So to be clear, we're talking about how you see you not how you really are.
The lower self-esteem over its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
adolescents with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, they participate in more diet not healthy that they can bring them into a food supply.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this for what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol and drug abuse and drugs, diets <unk> surgery aesthetics, aesthetics, sex relationships and <unk> <unk>
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who think they're overweight again, again, regardless of whether they have or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
<unk> percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way they can see.
Think for a moment in what this is making our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is of interest to each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways. The first is that we have to nurture trust in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the light pressure and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really surprised when I learned that a lot of programs <unk> without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we should make sure that the program that our children follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
So these six aspects are set points for anybody to provide an education in body self-esteem than it works.
One education is fundamental -- but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take charge of each of us and be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
And the current status of the way women are seen and I talked about our circles.
It's not good to have the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people for what they are, not as you see it.
All of us can start doing it by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published on our social networks.
We can bring people together based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, When was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and like companies, to change our culture, so that our children are to grow up to value all of their people, valuing our individuality, the <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen, because we just will create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that you can see that they have never been <unk> of being who are, or to reach out what they want in their lives.
Think of what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
It was <unk>
It was <unk>
It was <unk>
His <unk>
It could be just the woman who is just two seats away. What would it mean for her if he was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, that he would tell him because they had no long legs -- he would get more <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were going to take this and tell your potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the imagery is <unk> to us all.
But let's take our children to the truth.
You know, the way you look at it is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because of how they make us feel.
It impacts self-esteem in the <unk>
So let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year's age of today, becoming agents of making sure of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On the five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by the <unk> rabbi, <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
At <unk> initially they would kill him, but being prisoner by other minor charges -- in the company of others, they started planning <unk> attacks in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations headquarters
Fortunately, those plans were <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb from 1993 in the World Trade Center couldn't get them.
Later on, he would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a <unk> an American mother, masters of elementary school, between the two they did for me for giving me a happy art.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to reach the same things in life.
Yet in all religion, in all human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who were <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think that we need to use all the possible means to everyone live like them.
A few months before arrest him, he sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekends of week, he and some friends, had been going to try to throw it on Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing that our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my father -- my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point to the target to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that I shot shot with I gave the little orange light on the goal and to surprise you, especially of me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned to the rest and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
From such a parent, maybe child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they found out as funny.
Did you see me in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
These people later would be condemned by putting a van with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground city of the northern tower in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved on 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to make a lot of them.
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone already was a moment of pack and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class was often a victim of <unk>
My secret secret is my identity to avoid being the white thing, but it will be the new class of the class, silent, was enough <unk>
So most of the time was going on home by reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons they did not develop social skills, to say <unk> to grow <unk> not prepared for the real world.
I was raised to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or his religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way to think, was during the 2000 elections.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National <unk> Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the theme of juvenile violence, as I had been a victim of <unk> almost my entire life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had done friendships, was Jewish age.
I took several days out of the light, and I realized that there was no <unk> among the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of having been able to overcome the barrier that all life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer work in Bush -- <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All the life was taught that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
I had an opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat exotic people, exactly the way I wish I would be treated.
I was able to contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that would be homosexual but I know what is being measured by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart asked me to be <unk> honest with my <unk> and helped me see that the race of the people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my figure on a moment that I was desperately <unk>
On occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how my thinking was changing my thinking, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of somebody who had had enough <unk> <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hatred inside you.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break my relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and get me into a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to take the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better way, that even though I was invited to this violent ideology.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, and the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism talking to those <unk> acts like rejection to the actions of my father.
With this simplicity I put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that your children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Right now there is a film that is projected in your mind.
It's an incredible film movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound that you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has sound, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that project in front of your eyes.
And it's constantly having a superimposed voice in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie, tea, you and you.
There is nothing that gets more directly.
At least, I know I have an <unk>
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not mindful conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have, what we get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
<unk> that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
Science, by nature, is objective
Consciousness is defined by nature.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all of the 20th century, we would understand that vision.
Psychology was studying the <unk> behavior. The neuroscience is studying the <unk> brain, but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, -- a <unk> of scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the search for correlations in some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of great work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of looking at faces or feeling <unk> or happy <unk>
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
And I would like to explain to you that this kind of work of neuroscience is responding to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what you do certain areas of the brain and what it is <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to the <unk>
There's actually no easy problem with consciousness.
Because it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal <unk> film.
Right now, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find an explanation.
The typical <unk> are all sorts of emerging behaviors, how they operate <unk> how they work <unk> how they are <unk> and <unk> living organisms are all questions about how they work target.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk to them, how we talk to them, how we talk to them, all these questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it's all being accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't really have much to say.
I am a <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> which works for a long time, I was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that it was not working for reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a pretty cool chain. We get used to this -- the physics of physics explains biology, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
For another, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision in the world.
I think consciousness right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate to our worldview, but we don't even know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for these crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Their crazy idea is that there is no such a difficult problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective subjective film, an illusion of illusion or confusion.
And actually, what we need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- the behaviors of the brain, and this is studies all that you need to explanation.
Well, more power for it.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of the purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to be satisfying it.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe like <unk> <unk> space, the space and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic terms.
Instead, it's considered fundamental and the world is built the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't tell the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space <unk> -- and -- <unk> laws of Newton. And so applied the basic laws of <unk> and applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws were <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- time, they mass, then they charge, then because of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that all of a sudden is not the object of science.
It opens up the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect awareness with other fundamental concepts -- space, the time, the mass -- physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everybody, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious -- not only the human, the dogs, the flies, the mice even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with heartbreak when you think about saying, as long as I always travel at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But thinking is that perhaps photons may have some element of a crude feeling of a crude feeling of some primitive <unk> of consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy thing for you.
How would someone think about something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental to it.
If it's fundamental -- like space, the time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people in different cultures, where the human mind looks more like nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing -- there's awareness.
<unk> of <unk> complex, as in a human being, conscious awareness.
<unk> of simple, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to show you about consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information, a high degree of information, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a middle degree of information, as much as significant degree of consciousness rather important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, the particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness about zero.
It actually represents a fundamental law of the top <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have been observed that physics is curiously abstract.
<unk> the structure of reality using lots of equations, but we don't talk about the reality behind it.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire come from?
From the <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be leaving as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts him in the equations.
In that view, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to celebrate our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that I had consciousness, then I must be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think this is how this tends to transform your vision, whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk> film.
It's <unk>
According to the vision of the information, she has a complicated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have quite serious ethical problems about the ethics of intelligent computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective countries, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a local level, an integrated group like the audience in a TED Talk, at this moment we have a TED consciousness -- an internal movie for this whole TED group, different from the internal movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually most confident from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second thing that is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right path towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve the night in the morning.
But I think we're finally going to be able to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the true key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village all Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, an <unk>
I went to school, my friends, <unk> me with my friends, younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to take it for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very beautiful -- but there is a problem with me.
She didn't actually get anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a underwater profile in the <unk> of my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the middle class of studies -- a guy lifted up the hand and said, "Hey, when will you give you your <unk>
And I said, "What's a <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for some good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in chairs with the wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with disability with disabled people.
And we don't are. And it's not <unk> I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there to inspire us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to hear them, right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they were lying in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something called a <unk> <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you remarkable for you.
It's not something wrong and he can't make a fantastic <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or you know, you know, "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> Before you <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without drawing drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with <unk> legs.
And there is a lot of these pictures, which is what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the term porn -- because we had a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disabled disabled, of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, really bad for my life, could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that have been approached by strange to express that you believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this is happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was going to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are <unk> to people with disability to benefit from people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something difficult.
And I think about a few things.
But the things that we have not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I have been <unk> by the so-called social model of disability, which tells us that we're more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way that we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "For God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I really know I am.
<unk> from other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't think that I am lucky to be lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to load your phone battery into your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we're going to do, and we were <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they have sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us a hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a stretch of stairs hasn't never become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a TV screen will not get the <unk> to the <unk> people.
Nor do you have a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turning all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl was sitting in his bedroom looking at <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered <unk> of anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people who are alive to get up of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the real achievement of disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at the age of 11 degree in a high school school is not a little surprised that their new teacher is a <unk> <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and football professional with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I just respond to one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
And when people think of <unk> they think about "Minority <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
Augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google Glass.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you relate to your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what it is running through the game of game to 160 <unk> the <unk>
We can know that it feels like a man at 110 pounds -- we got rid of <unk> trying to get it out of all of its being.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
So some videos to show you what it is to use Google <unk> under the hull, and give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they are not images of <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine coming up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment. You know, a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football field from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from Washington University.
<unk> <unk> Mice mice. Mice <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, will be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go to the next level?
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many of you know.
The Rift Valley has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, by why, with this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a Russian rollercoaster in his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you go through a <unk> video crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with your arm before running and making a <unk> What's the experience of a fan of a fan of it.
And when he can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball of the network? Or <unk> making a <unk> <unk>
What will be your experience when you drop out of a mountain to more than 100 miles like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they were <unk> the <unk> of <unk>
But this is not really <unk>
It's only virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
And we will remember augmented reality when the <unk> the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a brief refresher on the technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> had a <unk> to his <unk> in the field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to do it.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> placed radios on the <unk> of the field <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you're going to be a player going back to your group and see her next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you wear in front of you, no longer will have to worry about forget a <unk>
or to memorize the strategy.
You just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose games, and they hate to lose them.
If you lose yourself in you as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a <unk> <unk>
Augmented reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your form of playing the game.
So how do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera in every corner of the stadium with a view from the top of the people that's down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones will have an information <unk>
This is <unk> the good bad teams.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being just for <unk>
It'll be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the <unk>
Let's take the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receptor Suddenly, a <unk> on the left-hand side of your bombsight is going to show you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you usually don't believe it, but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
They went to the protection.
Another <unk> you tell you that there's an open receptor.
You get the <unk> but you were <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land yet, the receptor sees its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
<unk> picks up the <unk> runs and <unk>
The audience is mad, and the fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to do a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
Augmented reality will be part of sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy among human beings, to show someone how it is, literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live being <unk>
How much is it for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of kids to think about space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, augmented reality gets close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as always, of us.
Thank you.
I was recently <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years old, I was <unk> the southern end of Bertie County, which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known to its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> a chief chief engineer who was building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical, nor <unk>
But from his openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has become <unk> like that, so that the decline of all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a fall of four to five seconds, the body hits the water <unk> about 120 miles an hour.
The impact is broken your bones, some of which will be vital organs.
The majority of the impact.
The ones that no, they normally fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the people who <unk> this method of suicide will realize the <unk> death will be <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel, the bridge.
So here is where most people are in order to take away their life.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on that edge, and in the darker time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who will fail to suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way ever since.
Today, medical officials and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him on the <unk> last year when you get a call from a man called a suicide bomber sitting in the <unk>
<unk> and when I arrived, I watched Jason talking with an Army officer.
Jason was only 32 years old and she had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times before from New Jersey to try and suicide from this bridge.
And after about an hour talking to <unk> we asked ourselves if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped about <unk> he leaned over to the right, and he left.
This guy, this kind of clever kid in New Jersey had just taken away my life.
I spoke to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess that when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the girl's rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had order.
<unk> signs affect a lot of people.
And I ask them these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone or someone or somebody was <unk>
What about <unk>
Tell me what that?
In my experience, it's not just to talk, but you have to hear.
Listening to understand.
You don't get <unk> or tell the person you know how to feel, because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about the end of life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there's nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
And I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read you his letter.
She lost his son on January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he was with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go standing on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you with a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends that tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but feeling more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with her father the 19 of January.
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the car of Mike was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> at the afternoon of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who may be temporarily too much to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before not having a real infectious disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go to the bridge that his son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, I wrote to a radio call by a possible guy called a suicide bomber on the sidewalk close to the northern tower.
I would take my swam on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, they cross the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and a half later, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided that he says that day back to that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came up with it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked her, "What did he <unk> and give the hope to hope and <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, <unk> <unk>
I was left to speak and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to give you <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> nothing erase the events of 11 of March, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin still carry with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness that has been properly <unk>
I read Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious from all those traits -- but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We give God thanks for you.
<unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she was writing, <unk> when I visited the General in San Francisco at the night, you were <unk> as the patient.
I thought I did have to get it up.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a <unk>
It speaks openly about the events of that day and its depression with the hope that its story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I have found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather got killed with poison.
That act, despite the end of their own pain, theft the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most of the people who are <unk> or those who consider the suicide, you wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own <unk>
Usually this is achieved only from three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls from suicide around the bridge.
In those incidents I've been directly involved, just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
And for that time, I got my hand at three times.
In the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few people have jumped out of the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that they leave around the side, they realized they made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connects to San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everybody and each of us should be striving to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There's help. There are hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question asks you, how do you lie on that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I was finally achieved the dream that I had had since I was a child.
My foreign outside I would end up with my inner truth, with my inner myself.
So for complicated reasons, what I'm going to refer to later, when I look at this picture -- I think, and I thought, you know, <unk> it <unk>
But the last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all benefit from our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of limitations by skin color or because of the beliefs of those people around us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my even, ignored my story.
I think this enigma is called a revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt in the head.
And my mom wondered, "Why do you always take that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but we now know that, in fact, it's most complex and mystery stuff.
Because of my success, I never tell myself to share my story, not because I think that being a bad person, but because of how the world comes to those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day. I appreciate being a woman.
I have mama, dad and my family who take me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something like me, this is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15, when I still wore a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the Director of a beauty of beauty <unk>
That night, she asked me, "Why haven't you done on the competition of <unk>
He told me that if she <unk> she went out of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won <unk> I won in <unk> I won in <unk> and he got a third <unk> over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of <unk>
Not many people can say that their first work was queen of beauty of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when he went to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more important than that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that he passed my application for the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was <unk>
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you go to the United States -- you can change the name and your identity <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me to put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when she was taught in Thailand to 19 years.
It's funny that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
At that time in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before changed the name and the gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, your identity document means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was a license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears were seen <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York City, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> lived in his truth, but that <unk> put himself to his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November we make a global vigil for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who were <unk> and he stood in front of injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that there is no longer any more <unk> than 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. <unk> first, thank you to all my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to younger young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were calling me and told me that his parents couldn't take it, and I took the phone, and I said, "Mommy, can't you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's not just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we were all assigned a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes that <unk> not block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to move, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
It should have understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when he was <unk> their efforts in 2011, to <unk> the National <unk> of peace, became very famous -- a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the story of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies, right from the beginning, when birth a child, their birth will not be saved.
It's not welcome, and his father and his mother.
The neighborhood comes in, day its <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot about having a little girl.
When I give birth to the first child, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, he feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the mother of it, but the daughter. The daughter just <unk> when it grows, he suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, he stays at home and the school admits of his siblings.
Up to the age of 12 years in a way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when you go back in adolescence, when it comes 13 years old, you would assume that he went out of her house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and her family and her family, and if you put the code of that French of course.
And it's interesting that this particular code of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affecting the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of his sisters at the name of honor.
And there is a standard of traditional societies, which is called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and that accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the elderly -- even if they don't want it.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like it, or if he <unk> it with an old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, you have to follow it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then give birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and it continues.
I said, brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I <unk> I thought of his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half and a half and a half years old, I was <unk> in my school.
Can you be wondering why I have to mention a girl in a school?
Yes, I have <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the industrialized societies in tribal societies, it's a great event for life life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
<unk> means that it's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and you would be spent two weeks earlier, when I put out the form of painter <unk> and I was in the relative part of some of my sisters.
And the reason was, I'd never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason that value to my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and her daughters, thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends were coming to see me.
<unk> to go with me to different meetings.
And all these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education to <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students, to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all social and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
<unk> were banned from going to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and let me go to the markets.
Musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have these people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the 10 years, <unk> got up and got up for the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog blog he was offered her same for the New York Times documentaries and he spoke on every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It's <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and October nine of 2012, shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would lie to my wife and "I must be <unk> by what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> told me, "Please don't tell you."
<unk> the fair cause.
You know, you have your life in game because of the cause of peace, because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were both on the right path and God <unk>
So these few words were <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe headaches and loud headaches because his facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow which was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter was never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with my face.
I'm going to make it right. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
You know, when you don't just get his task.
They fight with his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's special about my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave <unk> and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain about 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I am engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google Map, of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> Google <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you cling to a brain surgery.
You're still as smart or not?
If you don't, you'll be able to get <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And immediately after the operation, I had to decide what quantity to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I've had to decide on all combinations and mix them chemicals, and try to take it to live with life.
More than I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to be able to try to get the dose of it, because there really doesn't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I began to try a different <unk> and I was shocked by seeing how small changes in the dose dramatically changed my <unk> my sense of who I was me, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, and I tried doses and typical chemical for a man of <unk> and I was surprised by seeing how my thoughts changed my thoughts.
I was always thinking, I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several guys like this, or perhaps some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as an end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> so much <unk> fixing a problem that I had to the front, and it just wouldn't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience, I gave myself a new appreciation for men and about what they have to do, since then I've been better with men.
And what I was trying to do is set up those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was regain my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I usually think of almost always in pictures, and that became my key point of <unk> how to get those mental images that I use to create -- to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> as <unk> Descartes and <unk> looked at things in similar ways.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, mental imagery are fundamental to think about <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I get to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and well <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use its imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician, you could extract the music of his head?
There's incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting this with two recent experiments that were done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, MRI imaging -- to represent the brain, and here you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows a scan of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The column in the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as you see it, looking at that same image.
The column on the right is <unk> the content of the central column on the left, you see that the difference is nearly <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same image is nearly <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab, in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual <unk>
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while <unk> their brains to create a large pool of reactions from the brain in the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as well as a new <unk>
The computer, using just the brain information that comes up with it to show what seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're pretty close to it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you look at an image and when you imagine that same picture, you believed in the brain the same <unk>
This was led to the brain scanning systems of higher resolution, and their resolution has increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we do that?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many of them are proposing new projection techniques from images, including me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we have to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger, but at this point, <unk> magnets only offer small improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different <unk> like a <unk>
And why does this care?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in the MRI were to make magnets really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of brilliant and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the radios and special radio receivers in MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field, we can put magnetic patterns together, structured magnetic patterns.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of regular radio frequencies, we can increase <unk> the information that you can extract in one single <unk>
Also, we can then split up in layers our growing knowledge of brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only blood fluid, but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity direct this is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas in direct shape to digital media.
Can we imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is something big.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible to use as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more choices to open up this door.
Anyway, you choose one year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
Their closet is probably telling you to some person for the first time you love it, or tell someone you're pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other conversation difficult for the one that you have through life.
So all I'm going to do is a hard conversation and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through multiple phases of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> <unk> <unk> like a <unk>
And I will be slope with the <unk> of my <unk> and I have <unk> my head -- I would usually ask myself, usually a child -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there was a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I put my jaw a little longer, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father was <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother had a cold, looking at his son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised my next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence but this time was prepared and was about to get into the <unk> of female issues at the table.  He had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> quotes <unk>
Even a snippet of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I took a deep breath down, and I went down the look and my back and my back, a four year-old girl with a pink dress -- looking at what is not a challenge for a feminist, <unk> a little girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And so I took it back back, again, I got <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is <unk>
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw her clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress -- and sometimes you like to use a <unk> <unk>
I am more of the kind of <unk> <unk>
And that little girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about <unk> <unk>
It was the hardest conversation than ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some biomes in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from you or yours or yours.
<unk> I'm going to give you 100 reasons for why to go out of my closet was harder than getting out of his, but this is the thing: The hard thing is not <unk>
What's difficult is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who has declared online, rotate it is harder than saying it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story I'm going to tell you is harder than telling your five-year-old son that you're going to get in.
There's no more difficult thing -- there is just the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult about how difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse than we have to feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make sense of security or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls are, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
I had a horse tail, one dress and dress shoes high.
It wasn't the lesbian <unk> prepared to fight any child in four years to go into coffee.
I was frozen for fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay, <unk> <unk> and moving only one muscle is the scariest thing ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers I've spent my entire life trying to deal with not <unk> and now the world was turned on to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't spears that <unk> you kill.
One of my most memorable launches was on the wedding of my sister.
It was the first time that many of them knew that I was gay, and when I do my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my black dress and my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me was years old.
And after talking a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and it's never talked about having <unk>
So what is your TV TV show.
Our <unk> <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting to show her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like all the Scud <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the real thing that you get.
That's how hard conversations are still not my strong point.
Ask anybody that I was <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Sean <unk>
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready to battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the other needs to know that they also <unk>
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they are gay, <unk>
If they say their parents who might maybe be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex ones.
You communicate your truth.
You would never be embarrassed by that.
And some of the people can come out and be injured safe, because they have done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you might feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So next time you find in a dark hall, a <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And it may be very yourselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of what intelligence, one example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submersible can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this was made it as a criticism to the computer <unk> like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try and understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
We first start with a thought experiment.
Imagine that you are from a <unk> race that you don't know about the biology of Earth nor from the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and you have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about intelligence on the Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until a certain time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet <unk> stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I did have done several years ago, I studied a variety of topics through science, through several disciplines, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there's been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked, did a number of years ago: There is an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I've ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is an educational force, that acts in the end of maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the choices open with a force -- with the diversity of possible future -- to the diversity of possible time, <unk> to an impending time.
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintaining open.
And so having in account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
Do you have the intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life they should have to have a tendency to conditions more favorable for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what happens if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy production, but actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> which is designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that is located inside.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple animal tests playing human games, and even making human games, and they even make any money out of them, and you have to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He simply decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance have applications for <unk> robotics and <unk> technology.
This ability to use tools will be applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, like some other animals can cooperate by pulling opposite extremes of a rope at the same time to liberate the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
So for example, here we have successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> <unk> new connections on a social network where your friends are constantly trying and keep the network of the completely connected network.
This same network of network <unk> also has applications in health care, and energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the pathways of a fleet of boats, discovering success and using the Panama Canal to expand the global Canal to the Pacific to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of negotiation -- successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability to risk management has broad applications in finance, and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of different cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all derived from a single equation, that leads to a system of maximize your future freedom for action.
Now, here's a very profound irony.
So let's go back to the beginning of the term of the robot, the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if you were <unk> smart machines, there would be a foreign <unk>
The machines were <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had the whole concept of <unk> rebellion in reverse.
It's not that the machines are getting smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all the future possible is a fundamental principle that the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise out directly to take control, rather than being upside down.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do we search for goals to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants of them to help them build artificial jobs, or to help them understand human intelligence, is the following: intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the age of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Even in the last few years, we have <unk> our knowledge of how the Earth fits into the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one of the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint intensity of stars when the planets go through in front of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that we're going to go.
The data gathered by Kepler the size of the planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their mother's star.
So together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth's solar system, and also the amount of light that receives from their <unk>
Instead, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we are finding this comparison of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> 2014 was the hotter <unk>
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us for the millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale has <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a scientist in the weather, and I'm not <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the planet just discovered and planets that we know better: our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and even though it's a little further away from the Sun, it may be a potentially habitable world, shown that by a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track its surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
So the satellites that <unk> as the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere <unk> and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not just short space flights but also a tantalizing chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, <unk> remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> and compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still in <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and most <unk> and the world's Earth is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our forests from a thousand kilometers away.
I worry that this excitement of the colonization of Mars and other planets will get a big, sad <unk> the implication, and the belief of some of us that Mars will expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable Earth.
So as much as I like exploration exploration, I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to respect humanity is as figuring out the captain of the Titanic will comment later on the <unk>    Thank you.
But the goals for climate exploration, and the land preservation is not <unk>
No, it's actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They're just closer to home.
And if we can understand how to create and maintain spaces that are embedded in the hostile and <unk> spaces of the ground, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment with you, the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi were asked to have in mind that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox is that when civilizations become very advanced enough to consider to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of what's important to protect the origin of the planets that we organize this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to deal with the hostile environments for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see out the window that they were at the dining table in the dining table, where he had <unk>
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all very closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and my <unk>
<unk> expensive, but it's sure that no more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, even though the circumstances of the circumstances, stopped.
I'm a child? <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> which increases your heart rate, and I'll get the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the <unk> <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something that I could do -- systems that could put in his place, which would make it happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, the probability of it is a total catastrophe of it.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't work.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winning from the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called <unk> retrospective
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written out of this a few years before, known as <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as explains <unk> you look forward and trying to figure out all the things that you could go wrong, then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about you is from some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, it will take a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space <unk> works.
There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to take a tracking of the location of the important things, where the fish are right, where the fish are places that are <unk> where the groups are friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the London <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find your nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they still could find his nuts.
They were not using smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that they move too much.
This is the reason for losing your car, glasses of reading and <unk>
So at home, you put a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For her <unk> a particular drawer.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you pick up a place, and they are <unk> with it all the things will always be out there when you get them.
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card cards, stop driving, <unk> <unk> by mail to themselves.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of the practical practice is to recognize that low stress won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation that when you face to a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a dear to you, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all decision-making decisions and made for financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take from that would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and your cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack, brain injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that helps you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and he knows that it's one of the most important drugs in the world today, and you even know that you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you have to ask for the most of the doctors don't want to speak, and pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or transplant surgery in any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And you must think about what kind of statistic <unk> it's <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's fault someone, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood that well <unk>
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of the drugs is just about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> <unk> what do you think is it?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This is by the research on the cynical investigators <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I was the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke, brain or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability of 300 to a <unk>
Why not not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask one more statistic -- and it is, <unk> the effects of <unk> Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects produced in five percent of patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain, but now they're thinking, <unk> five percent of them are not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
And remember, low stress don't think clearly.
So think about how we <unk> this over time, so you don't have to make the chain chain on the act.
300 people take the dog, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 has side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get infected with the drug that the drug will help you.
I'm not saying you should or not take the <unk>
I just say they have to have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is part of the beginning of the informed consent principle.
We have a right to have access to these kinds of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air on the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
To make surgery that more is done in young men in the late men in the late men -- <unk> of cancer -- the number of cancer is the number you need to deal with is <unk>
This is, 49 surgeries for a person who has helped.
And the side effects in that case, are produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or erectile <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if it's lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent effects -- only one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before time, the questions that you can argue that we would get the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a <unk> option, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change the heat of the moment, but at least you are trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that it turned out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face Face <unk> <unk> is not necessary or <unk> or <unk> or immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very quickly. They could be lunch to the lions, so nothing really matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go through the window during those moments of stress is the rational logical thinking, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown you.
So we have to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a time.
The idea is to think about the future of how you could be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things happening in the first place.
I went back to the night after snow, in Montreal when I returned from my journey, my contractor gave me a <unk> of combination with the door, with a key to the front door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots and lots of letters that I have not <unk> and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch <unk>
Two <unk> <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may never go to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The French signs of French signs came over the 1970s, and over time, he mixed with local signs, and developed the language we know as a <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true at all.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really are in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a <unk> world is like I lived in a foreign country following their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms of <unk>
So how do I understand the one?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my little <unk> and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people answers.
So I've learned for example for example.
<unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise from eating the bag of potato <unk>
"You don't <unk> and when you're eating, you don't get the covered in the <unk>
All of this is called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound label more than the average person does.
I'm a super <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is about coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
We would try to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In the culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
But for me, I do whatever my thumb is like this is not natural.
That's why I only have four lines in the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At the time, the sound was the trend and that was called me <unk>
There was no visual art.
Now the sound has gone into my territory of art.
Am I going to ask you more than art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not just experienced through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or something visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and get it.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, he was <unk> with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the background of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a little <unk>
And the sound is so powerful that it would well <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could tell you to me.
I chose that I was <unk>
There's a massive culture around speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I had no voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me like the same and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, the work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking <unk> their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as you take a loan in a very high rate.
If I'm not going to carry on with this practice, I feel like I could get in the <unk> and not having any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can tell you about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> what it means that subtle changes can affect all of the signals as much of the signals as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you get a better understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> split up in many different parameters.
If you <unk> a different <unk> for every finger while you touch the piano, like facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand, and so as you touch the piano, English is a linear, language, as if you just touch one key at the same time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept, or an idea in <unk>
If only one key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal is <unk>
This is the signal <unk>
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I was <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and it would push it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
So for example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is "All day."
If you pick it up, and you get the velocity, the visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said of <unk> the <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time is expressed in <unk> and how distance the body is able to express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> so much time."
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk>
Watch <unk> hand right, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
Everyone with your hands on top.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like his chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please stop it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good work.
Now look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest -- but they carry it very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and thriving just like music.
Yet today, we live in a very tight world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have the sound sounds, it doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines the social value and allow them to grow their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not that you have to hear to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I would like to take you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say to me, "You can get it all up, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I have to say, because the adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good for cleaning the others.
The time, now I'm an adult and teaching citizenship and invention in South Hong Kong.
You don't expect a lot to wait for my students to walk on the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we have been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those plastic chunks to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and we put this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge boats
So along with my students, six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> job <unk> so that the kids are very <unk> they can also participate in.
And I'll tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That we do.
I leave it with the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to get them into something that we hope to work.
So we decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, we just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the children get a lot with the robots.
And then we started building what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick at creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we transform light bulbs and web cameras on accessories. And we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly out of the water and because of the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board processing this image and measure the size of each other, to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this invention to step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
And my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
You see the news -- you get the Internet, and you get rid of this <unk>
A child, maybe younger than 10 years, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands of the world in <unk> the world's largest <unk>
They were really surprised because this is the water you drink, it's the water in which the water <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see the water is brown, the mud and oil is also brown color, and when it's <unk> it's very difficult to see what in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be built through all sorts of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help a remote form of other children.
I was able to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away from perhaps a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power plant close to water.
And today, as an average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like the bulk of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and the majority, at the time, it has safe, is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've returned to <unk> every year from the accident and research with other scientists, the Earth, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't forget it.
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with <unk> all his life.
Together with them we discussed the data we were talking about, and we talked about what we were going to do next, <unk> <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant plant plant.
We created the <unk> map of <unk> we introduced pigment to represent real-time data of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So we were able to see that the radioactive powder is going to come up from the top of the mountain to the system of <unk> and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organized an civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We zoom in to 1.5 miles of nuclear power, and with the fishermen of <unk> and we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> of sediment as we invented and we built it.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a so much small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optical tasks, you can basically build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of kids can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy.
For example.
Or we can help in mobility in the advanced population transforming their standard boat chairs in new <unk>
The plastic, oil and oil are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are <unk>
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizens of scientists, creators, we have to prepare the next generation to worry about the environment and people, and so that I can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a single thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One of them puts up on the environment, the other thing he believed.
One is designed by nature, the other one.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the marble <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only tool by Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smaller units of life, the cells, we took all of the information that was required for each cell to work and to make it happen.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production mass.
<unk> lines have <unk> a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk> with little <unk>
You act primarily like filter the other mainly as the barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my vision of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect, to work between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, analysis and synthesis, it shows in both two screens after me.
My work, in the simplest level, try to bring these two visions of the world, pull away from the assembly and get to growth.
You probably ask yourselves why now?
Why could it not be possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment in history, where I <unk> four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I created it.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools and tools through large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with a scope of <unk> meters with a <unk> base that one day is not very distant to print <unk> buildings, which shine on the darkness.
So here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where each opening is just to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion fashion from Paris with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing printing -- we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet is combined materials and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner too.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and <unk> instruments that allows them to design products that are <unk> not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed an acoustic chair, a comfortable structural chair and also comfortable with sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator went back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this <unk> surface pattern becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, changes its functionality not by addition to the addition of another material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> the material itself.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible -- and one of them got stuck and came to define a lot of what matters.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between <unk> branches, and leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made it grow trees with twigs, cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made out of place.
I often ask myself, "What would design be if objects were made of a <unk>
Tell a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the material that is <unk> the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced each year by shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune out to your properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it the legal <unk>   We would do a lot of <unk> <unk> the <unk> and produced <unk>
And the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to get a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft, transparent.
To print the structures at a large scale, we built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> controlled <unk>
So the robot could vary the properties of material on the march and create these structures made from one single <unk> material, 100 percent recyclable material.
And when the pieces are <unk> you dry them dry to find a natural form in contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the process of printing used to be used to contain <unk> <unk> that first appeared on the planet a billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition from no problem with no problems to call them <unk> and if it grows more more, to window.
A <unk> tree.
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp plots in an architecture that acts like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects that are designed to <unk> in the sea, <unk> the life <unk> and placed on the ground, they're going to grow a tree.
The match to our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> <unk> we made our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about the synthetic biology like liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals that are <unk> new biological <unk> in very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops.
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
He lives in our oceans and the fresh water.
And the second E. E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
One becomes the light in sugar, the other transport of sugar and produces a useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the <unk> tract that will help you flow these bacteria and to make it <unk> their function of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, we will measure the material properties of the material of the <unk>
If we wanted more photosynthesis, you take more transparent channels in it.
So this <unk> digestive system, when it stretches from one end to another, it's 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut thin.
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels with life inside your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are very long, <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk> matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin <unk> the tissue harmed and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this material ecology of it.
To do that, you always need to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer built into layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture a home within which it was <unk>
The manufacturing is not about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
A acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, putting those fibers out of each other.
And this is happening through scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, creates a bone structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, manifest itself in one material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of an silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when we put the silk worm in a flat patch of it, not within a box, we realized that they were going to be <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different environments, different <unk> and we've discovered that the form, the composition, the structure of the <unk> <unk> directly through the environment.
Often the silk worms are often <unk> up to death within its <unk> its silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape <unk> silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climb this process up to the scale scale.
We had a <unk> robot making <unk> and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms are going to become more dark and cool areas that we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, distributes the silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms to an area farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put it carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much longer.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> they give all this pavilion, their integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> worms worms -- <unk> miles away.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full gaps.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to products and the buildings around us, to form a two of two materials, the designers have to bring these two visions of the world.
So it takes us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads to a design inspired by nature inspired by design, which demands us, for the first time, that we make care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked you, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time this?
You can touch your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you want to be <unk>
It's caused by some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be from <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and time took websites and also playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general I like to test and persist in anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this sense of encouraging this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it out.
But then I went through something else, something completely different, and I get involved in it, and I get to absorb and I feel <unk> I have found the <unk> and then again, this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to let it out.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing to deny all my own passions, and I would go to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me not to get out of nothing.
I was worried about being afraid of commitment, or being dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have been asked to have been then.
And ask themselves, where learned to assign the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they <unk> the culture of culture.
You ask first what you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were going to take that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, whether it's <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is done to us over and over again, as we grow up in various ways, <unk> to high school students are asked to be asked in college.
And at some point, what do you want to be about <unk>
It's about being the cute exercise before you take away your dream.
Why?
While this is inspired kids to dream with whatever they might be, isn't inspired to dream with everything that they might be.
In fact, right now, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are <unk> maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he is <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of living is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real vocation, the idea that every one of us has something to be involved in your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and dedicate your life to it.
But if you are somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up as curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There is no place for somebody like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for this to say.
It could help if you divide up in three different <unk> multiple <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we put in the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance the ideal was the ideal one who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> whatever term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as a limitation or <unk> you have to win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new at the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests on this process of data, visualizing data, travel, mathematics and design, to found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates inspired jewelry.
<unk> and Rachel came up with this whole idea of <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening in intersections.
Hence the new ideas come from.
And the <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these kinds of intersection.
The second superpower <unk> is learning learning.
When we get them <unk> we are going to do it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to being dealt with it because of having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our areas.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start from scratch.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a Polish pianist -- an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known.
Before I become a writer, <unk> it was financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when he was starting their thumb, and this ability will help him write compelling launches for the editors.
It rarely is a waste of time to get what you want, even if we end up with it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to change anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes a director of other videos, other pages a web phone designer, sometimes a Kickstarter, and sometimes apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> magazine, defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so fast and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to be able to meet the market needs of the market that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're pushed to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster people who are themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart.
They came out of the belly knowing knowing that they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams got up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that will engage with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them will be told to be more like their <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing you can take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal wiring -- whatever it is.
If you are a heart attack, then you get through all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with his many passions.
Keep his curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> they took her to a psychiatric psychiatric
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately, it passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a look at the <unk> and they found weird and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If <unk> had been alive today, we couldn't give her more help than <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnostic diagnosis we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from <unk> many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been achieved on treating Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you hope to live until 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's may be almost one of two in two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that your years <unk> with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or want to take care of Alzheimer's.
In the U.S., Alzheimer's health care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and their costs will increase in five times by 2050, as the generation of the generation of the <unk> booms as well.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little done for <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> to cure or even slow its development.
We understand less about Alzheimer's than other diseases because we spend less time and money on the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's disease and cause a number of annual numbers of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to an fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what a few people knows, but the whole world, Alzheimer's world, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all scientists, scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just have to look at a picture of a healthy brain as compared to a patient Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a loss of memory and mental abilities, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reducing significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers on the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these dots <unk> end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are <unk> they stay outside the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There is a lot of steps, and the identification of what steps blocked is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
You put a wire out of a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that it goes on, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in its most part, they have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors -- biologists, biologists, chemicals, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that spike specifically this step to stop the disease.
So let me show you some of our last results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick into each other within them, like human with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see it <unk> and live a normal life.
So this is just a positive start, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, I beat the Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to figure out how Alzheimer's is a disease and if we get it, we can make it <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have raised more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry and <unk>
That was essential to advance the HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit today to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden, caregivers of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the New York Times in January of this year.
In love with someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and from my own experience to try it myself a night from last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers were <unk> to make 36 questions more and more personal and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions for example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you were going to get another person?
And <unk>
We have to <unk> these are increasingly personal <unk>
Number <unk> I really <unk> <unk> to your partner what you like about it or her, I know I'm very honest at this time, and I gave things that you don't know.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really little detail was struck by me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course I was also <unk>
And when I had the chance of trying this studio, with someone I knew not particularly well -- I didn't expect to be <unk>
But I thought it was a good story, and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the neocortical column a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you will probably ask some of you -- keep it together yet.
And the reason I think this is because I've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the paper was published, I was really nervous.
I'd been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had told me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand views.
And that led a good burden of attention to a relatively new relationship.
But because I had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday night, and I already got on Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I already had called prejudice and Show and Good <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million pages, and I was like, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is foster trust writing honestly, but another thing is to discover that life love from one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they always, the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for my email with the phrase, phrase: <unk> <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers and <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately became red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international states, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for Saint <unk> which included the experiences of readers by testing the study with different degrees of success.
So my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both make a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and I would take orders for photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons of the <unk> process, a range that I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked out, they wanted to know if it really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce love <unk> not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt, mostly the wrong question.
How do you know if we put together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of making these 36 percent less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the research goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking at foster <unk> among college students, using what they <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
Participants were felt closer after doing that, several later studies, they also used <unk> protocol -- as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community and they've used it between people of the opposite political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, who combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a <unk> liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed to be upset about it.
And I said, "You want to say that you get rid of the person with you who do it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but it became better friends?
<unk> that I did have managed to get better better after testing the research research.
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation of it.
I had that relationship since I had 20, which I was supposed to probably all my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how if I could live without him.
So I took it into science.
And so I did everything I could find out about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could kind of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I just thought about this for the book I wrote -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I had the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used to sit then.
And all this knowledge has been useful from one or a different way.
I am more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I am after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably can demand me.
What I'm looking for love is an hour, not just to be <unk> today, and to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that the guarantee that people would ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told you about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very scary story because they fall in love to feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we are very willing to take the short version of the story.
The version of the story that says, still together?
And their content with a response of S or No.
So more than a question, would you submit that we make questions harder -- questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things get together, and how do you know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known year -- and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love with it is not the same as it will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. Love did not happen.
<unk> in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit when I read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered anything to that choice.
I didn't think about how we would have both to make that decision, and how I would have to keep making that choice without knowing if he always chose or not.
I want it to be done enough to have done and said, 36 questions, you've chosen to love somebody so generous, and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe of.
And what I want, and what maybe spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the chance of choosing someone, and the hope that he also would love me, and it's frightening, but that's a scary deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some <unk> <unk> and in a way, I was like a <unk>
And the city of New York does a time.  Something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
So I took a wooden box out of the wood, a dollar, a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some <unk> <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment since I was in <unk> <unk> like going to go from tour and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a job for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took out all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> style.
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it is <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking that he could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite of it, in some way it looked like it increased size, as if it was that I was playing the text with a <unk>
So I did <unk> I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, and we were physically weird bottles that I was finding out on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow up with you just like drawing like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects out and I created my own taxonomy of specimens with them.
First, <unk> that you can get an idea.
Then I made insects and strange creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point, I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the layers of glass, similar to the drawing on a window on a window after the window, and the other window, and he had all these windows put together a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work with something very big, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by as much in the garden of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of their time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 yards of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, he's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
Are you going from the world of representation, this <unk> mesh mesh where they <unk>
So here is where the heads of animals are headed by <unk> ready to kill them in mass <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird a bird tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, are all sorts of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also sort of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand gets clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a dust to be the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a look like the <unk>
It's a little bit of a story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> that binds to the <unk>
Anyway, their tail turned to fire in a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
Their tail ends up in a <unk> eye that was made out of terrorists from 1986.
You've got them <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> in time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a project of six years to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a file of our culture, through media and material and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazine.
But each one is acting as a kind of a human being, and they travel in 20, four or 12 at a time.
They're like cells, they come together, they divide it.
And you can walk between them. It's taking me years.
Each one is basically a microscope microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can get it up the entrance.
I'm going to see you all over the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of your chest, and you cover the penis or whatever it is that you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick quick check of these works because I can't read it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body of half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this funny <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the cavity <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> box called <unk> <unk>
Within this box is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a museum, a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
You know, the box and all of the people in inside hits each other as the particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box in which it's living on.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the borders, the borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very facts about the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when you hurt your mind?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill have effect on pain, first goes through your stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
It's going to take a pill -- it's the most effective system for any single drug that has any effect on your body.
The <unk> however, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> they're going to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart count.
But they are also known for their side effects <unk> in its most negative, because in the time that it takes it to get to the current stream and worse even over time that it takes it to get to their fate, which is where it's more important in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the nodes. <unk> the system, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that were <unk> with antiretroviral drugs.
But after the treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with today's drugs that is a treatment treatment of life run out of anger.
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If you use them in <unk> for wounds and surgery and diabetes surgery, you can be used for anything else, including transportation <unk>
In fact, we're using pulses of laser to open or drill or drill extremely small holes, that open and closed -- almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask yourself, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small and a powerful laser beam on the membrane cellular membrane while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug absorbs in a matter of <unk>
Before you even noticed, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro technology or <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to be a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it's heading to the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, which releases it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total HIV eradication of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all the research researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups are doing when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better than these agents of violence and studying ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to civil <unk>
I do the field work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
No anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> were signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we even have to understand it or <unk> in any development process of successful conflicts.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why we do it, how do they do, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and political policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent nonviolent against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> also has established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
In the same way, the Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just to fire.
It's multitasking they're multitasking
And we put a complex machinery from <unk> stations. stations on TV, Internet channels, websites on social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
Common groups also invest in a complex fundraising <unk> but through <unk> businesses for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
Common groups also do something else: they create more strong ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run by hospitals, put in professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups also try to conquer the population to provide something that the state is not safe and security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn torn by war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also be understood by the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price for the population.
But in general, they provide social services that means filling a vacuum in a vacuum of a vacuum gap, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, election election in 2006 from Palestinian <unk> cannot be understood without recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at the groups of <unk> we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strength of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid are <unk>
<unk> because they fill out in the government, and they emerge as armed groups and politicians, engage in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated the more of these organizations, we are less likely to be able to move it into a state.
How do we call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory that run all of their function, collected the trash, and run the system of <unk>
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the weaker is states, like in the Middle East and the more <unk> the economic actors and their actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in no military tools.
<unk> that government vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and build peace.
If we better understand groups -- we will better understand what to offer to foster the transition from violence to violence.
In this new <unk> between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some battles, but not giving us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum vacuum in order to fill that vacuum vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions on gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the label of <unk> it would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And therefore I was struck by as a feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women who were <unk> <unk> with the men and they hated sex.
Today, I see how women are treated all around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time then, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It's going to be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a word <unk>
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who ask too much, with high self-esteem and dared to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until she realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also, proud to be.
For me, certain statements are <unk> women are equal to men.
They would get the same paycheck for the same job.
We have the right to travel around the world as it was free or violence.
We have a right to use easy and accessible to contraceptives and services that are <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There is more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to realize our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, and so much more.
We have to have to realize these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I went to work, I hear rap music.
Even though the letter degrades the women and this offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> the Yin of the Yin is incredible.
Do you actually love your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely upset by my musical act.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do -- <unk> --  -- all the <unk> but also killing insects, the <unk> of trash, the attention of the grass and the maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and the nice stuff.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> stories that come true.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's his choice, and I am not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, they accepted that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that the women are economically vulnerable when they were <unk>
Let's take this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism which has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the women of color, gay workers and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist feminist instead.
And also, as feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope we're going to be <unk>
When we get rid of it, we take them with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider that <unk> before I just try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> for fear of what that <unk> is not being able to be able to fulfill the <unk>
Take <unk> for example, or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> of three feet tall.
It was a <unk> show. I see this poop of embracing openly feminism and asking women and young men that will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started a lot of endless debates if it was -- or not the feminist feminist.
It <unk> their purpose instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection with <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need a lot.
We go far beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The wrong question or rather, an feminism more inclusive is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give the first one, go to action and be a little bit more brave.
If I hear music music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy to provide a potential supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they change the change affecting effectively their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions can justify this makes it more difficult for women to get gender equality, gender equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
It's two <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and also very brave. I want it to grow up in a world.
where they are <unk> by the strong creatures that are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the canal when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we heard songs that treat women as anything.
We can spend our money to go into the cinema in another part of the time when movies are not treating women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their companions as <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in your magazine, to participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't have enough number of women, so much to be making decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also help us to be even more as far as us to be <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision forward.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to the people in the corporate power and producers of film and music and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also say with bravery bravery and bad -- or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, above all, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
So a few kids would tell me when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
And my voice, and after everything I don't think I would say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was struck by a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
In the script of the script and also I discovered that if I was a little brave woman, another woman could come up and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I argue the original reality, that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think about what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we could all do the same thing.
I hope that we could all be a little courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had been <unk> to have visited <unk> or to be exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went across the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with a immune system, is one of the most easily diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> the autism.
But one time, it wasn't the article that unleashed controversy about autism and vaccines were <unk> disqualified and marked by being a <unk> fraud by British Medical <unk>
There is no most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world remain <unk> that vaccines will pay for their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
And the few psychologists and pediatricians that I had heard of it to talk about she believed to develop their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence were going stable only three or four children for every 10,000 dollars.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> of fundraising as <unk> <unk> they refer to autism as an HIV epidemic, as if I could get another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people for the Center for Disease Control what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> <unk> and a better detection detection to explain these numbers <unk>
But that kind of language didn't dissipate a lot of the fears of a young mother who searches in the face of his son, <unk> visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so reduced at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less than to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the intellectual power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health care.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with an infant psychiatrist -- Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital was published by Johns Hopkins Hospital.
They could do fun for hours by shaking their faces, but they were falling from panic by <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing it.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
For the 1950s, as the primary authority authority in the subject, I declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as it was <unk> references from places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the <unk> criteria for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> to give that diagnosis to children with structure, but we now know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had turned nine out of every 10 children sent by other doctors to his doctor's office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold parents.
These kids, he said, have been carefully kept in a refrigerator that we don't know.
At the same time, though, <unk> noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records he does correctly say, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills affirming things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own right, becoming invisible to the world in general.
So amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist, thought that the theory of mothers from <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband and her husband was John warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed Susie! No special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and his colleague Judith <unk> decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
We have a study of prevalence autism in the general population.
We had a suburb in London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse numbers.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the <unk> of <unk>
In another way, these children didn't fit in very beautiful and <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How no one had ever noticed about these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in <unk> in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time, no one wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article on the competition, but I was able to try it <unk> in his own work.
There was not even one translation to the English, but luckily, the <unk> husband was German, and he <unk> it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who was running an integrated clinic with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic began with music classes, and the kids followed their games on Sunday, the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as <unk> disability for life that required forms of support and <unk> spaces over the course of all life.
Instead of treating the kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's gave them their little teachers, and she started to help in the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
<unk> <unk> <unk> as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic features were common and they've always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> known as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even saying that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the late '80s, and the early '90s, their changes went into <unk> by <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad array of Asperger's <unk>
These changes didn't fall in <unk> broken.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked in between it to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> with four awards on <unk> <unk> psychologists, and parents and parents all knew what autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the very easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were hoping that this is how they were trying to get the people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and the services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> got to blame the vaccines for the increase in the diagnostics. A simple, powerful, powerful story and <unk> very bad story as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of prevention is that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, the <unk> the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have come together on the Internet to reject the idea that are puzzles for solving the new <unk> <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand the <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a deficit deficit to detail.
Certainly autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still catching <unk> which creates that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands in cover to <unk> the ship of <unk>
As we go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
